1
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:33,549
Hence! Home, you idle creatures,
get you home!

2
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,817
This is a holiday. What trade art thou?

3
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,556
Why, sir, a carpenter.

4
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:42,362
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?

5
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:44,095
You, sir, what trade are you?

6
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:48,697
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman,
I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.

7
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:51,471
But what trade art thou?
Answer me directly.

8
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:54,445
A trade, sir, that I hope,
I may use with a safe conscience,

9
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:57,574
which is indeed, sir,
a mender of bad soles.

10
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:01,813
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?

11
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,219
Why dost thou lead these men
about the streets?

12
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,659
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes,
to get myself into more work.

13
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,188
But indeed, sir,
we make holiday to see Caesar

14
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,532
- and to rejoice in his triumph.
- Wherefore rejoice?

15
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,365
What conquest brings he home?

16
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,937
What tributaries follow him to Rome,

17
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,978
to grace in captive bonds
his chariot wheels?

18
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:28,281
You blocks, you stones,

19
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:31,050
you worse than senseless things!

20
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:35,283
O you hard hearts,
you cruel men of Rome,

21
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,520
knew you not Pompey?

22
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:42,023
Many a time and oft have you climbed
up to walls and battlements,

23
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,033
to towers and windows,
yea, to chimney tops,

24
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,426
your infants in your arms,

25
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:51,130
and there have sat the live-long day
with patient expectation

26
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:54,241
to see great Pompey
pass the streets of Rome.

27
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,245
And when you saw his chariot but appear,

28
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,507
have you not made a universal shout,

29
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:02,415
that Tiber trembled underneath her banks,

30
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:07,351
to hear the replication of your sounds
made in her concave shores?

31
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:10,685
And do you now put on your best attire?

32
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,820
And do you now cull out a holiday?

33
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:16,059
And do you now strew flowers in his way

34
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:19,000
that comes in triumph
over Pompey's blood?

35
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,535
Be gone! Run to your houses,

36
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,835
fall upon your knees,

37
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:26,536
pray to the gods to intermit the plague

38
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:29,442
that needs must light on this ingratitude.

39
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,749
See where their basest metal
be not moved.

40
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,686
They vanish tongue-tied
in their guiltiness!

41
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:39,656
Go you down that way toward the Capitol.

42
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:44,024
This way will I. Disrobe the images if you
do find them decked with ceremonies.

43
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,757
May we do so?
You know, it is the feast of Lupercal.

44
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:50,666
It is no matter. Let no images be hung
with Caesar's trophies.

45
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,971
These growing feathers,
plucked from Caesar's wing,

46
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,973
will make him fly an ordinary pitch.

47
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,475
Who else would soar
above the view of men

48
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:01,412
and keep us all in servile fearfulness?

49
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:54,028
- Calpurnia.
- Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.

50
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:55,702
Calpurnia!

51
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,229
Here, my lord.

52
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:03,109
Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
when he doth run his course.

53
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:07,580
- Antonius.
- Caesar, my lord?

54
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,646
Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
to touch Calpurnia,

55
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,849
for our elders say, the barren touched
in this holy chase

56
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,155
shake off their sterile curse.

57
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,826
When Caesar says "do this,"
it is performed.

58
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:28,668
Set on and leave no ceremony out!

59
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:31,935
Caesar!

60
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:36,573
- Who calls?
- Bid every noise be still!

61
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,978
- Peace yet again!
- Who is it in the press that calls on me?

62
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,579
I hear a tongue,
shriller than all the music, cry "Caesar."

63
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:48,024
Speak. Caesar is turned to hear.

64
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,252
Beware the ides of March.

65
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:55,859
What man is that?

66
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,597
A soothsayer bids you
beware the ides of March.

67
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,271
Set him before me. Let me see his face.

68
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,909
Fellow, come from the throng.

69
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:20,687
Look upon Caesar.

70
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:24,764
What sayest thou to me now?
Speak once again.

71
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,727
Beware the ides of March.

72
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,901
He is a dreamer. Let us leave him.

73
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,908
Pass. Pass!

74
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:16,345
Will you go see the order of the course?

75
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,717
- Not I.
- I pray you do.

76
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:23,521
I am not gamesome. I do lack some part
of that quick spirit that is in Antony.

77
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,058
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.
I'll leave you.

78
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,725
Brutus, I do observe you now of late.

79
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,260
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
and show of love as I was wont to have.

80
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:38,399
You bear too stubborn and too strange
a hand over your friend that loves you.

81
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,671
Cassius, be not deceived.
If I have veiled my look,

82
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:44,273
I turn the trouble of my countenance
merely upon myself.

83
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,784
Vexed I am of late,
with passions of some difference.

84
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,250
Conceptions only proper to myself,

85
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,381
which give some soil, perhaps,
to my behaviors,

86
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:54,749
but let not therefore
my good friends be grieved,

87
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,294
among which number, Cassius,
be you one.

88
00:08:57,362 --> 00:09:02,027
Nor construe any further my neglect
than that poor Brutus with himself at war

89
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:04,896
forgets the shows of love to other men.

90
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,509
Tell me, good Brutus,
can you see your face?

91
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:15,277
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
but by reflection,

92
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,075
by some other things.

93
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,144
'Tis just. And it is very much lamented,
Brutus, that you have no such mirrors

94
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:23,382
as will turn your hidden worthiness
into your eye,

95
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:25,584
that you might see your shadow.

96
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,127
I have heard where many
of the best respect in Rome,

97
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:30,095
except immortal Caesar,

98
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:34,191
speaking of Brutus
and groaning underneath this age's yoke,

99
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:36,964
have wished
that noble Brutus had his eyes.

100
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,733
Into what dangers
would you lead me, Cassius,

101
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:41,367
that you would have me seek
into myself for that which is not in me?

102
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:43,502
Therefore, good Brutus,
be prepared to hear.

103
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:46,673
And since you know you cannot
see yourself so well as by reflection,

104
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:49,444
I, your glass, will modestly
discover to yourself

105
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:51,883
that of yourself
which you yet know not of.

106
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:53,978
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.

107
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:57,024
Were I a common laugher and
did use to stale with ordinary oaths

108
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,084
my love to every new protester,

109
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:01,994
or if you know that I profess myself
in banqueting to all the rout,

110
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,964
then hold me dangerous.

111
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,529
What means this shouting?

112
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:12,807
I do fear the people choose Caesar
for their king.

113
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,434
Ay, do you fear it?

114
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,406
Then must I think
you would not have it so?

115
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,711
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.

116
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,778
But what is it you would impart to me?

117
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:25,516
If it be aught toward the general good,

118
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,113
set honor in one eye
and death in the other,

119
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,556
and I will look on both indifferently.

120
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:32,427
For let the gods so speed me
as I love the name of honor

121
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:33,793
more than I fear death.

122
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:38,097
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
as well as I do know your outward favor.

123
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,865
Well, honor is the subject of my story.

124
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:44,233
I cannot tell what you
or other men think of this life,

125
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:47,378
but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be

126
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:51,041
as live to be in awe
of such a thing as I myself.

127
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,643
I was born free as Caesar. So were you.

128
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,785
We both have fed as well,

129
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:01,223
and we can both endure the winter's cold
as well as he.

130
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,891
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,

131
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:06,261
the troubled Tiber chafing at her shores,

132
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,529
Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius,
now leap in with me

133
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,764
"into this angry flood
and swim to yonder points?"

134
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,105
Upon the word, accoutered as I was,
I plunged in and bade him follow,

135
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,838
so indeed he did.

136
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,445
The torrent roared,
and we did buffet it with lusty sinews,

137
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,948
throwing it aside and stemming it
with hearts of controversy.

138
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,351
But ere we could arrive
the point proposed,

139
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:31,015
Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!"

140
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,695
And this man is now become a god,

141
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,492
and Cassius is a wretched creature

142
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:42,730
and must bend his body
if Caesar carelessly but nod on him.

143
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:47,403
Caesar! Caesar!

144
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:50,768
He had a fever when he was in Spain,

145
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:53,336
and when the fit was on him,
I did mark how he did shake.

146
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:57,647
It is true, this god did shake.
His coward lips did from their color fly,

147
00:11:57,786 --> 00:12:01,780
and that same eye whose bend doth awe
the world did lose his luster.

148
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,323
I did hear him groan.

149
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,656
Ay, and that tongue of his
that bade the Romans

150
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,923
mark him and write his
speeches in their books,

151
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:12,297
alas, it cried, "Give me some drink,
Titinius," as a sick girl.

152
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:16,664
Ye gods! It doth amaze me a man
of such a feeble temper

153
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,606
should so get the start
of the majestic world

154
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,606
and bear the palm alone.

155
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,577
Caesar! Caesar!

156
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:25,648
Another general shout.

157
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:30,619
Why, man, he doth bestride
the narrow world like a colossus.

158
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:34,290
And we petty men walk
under his huge legs

159
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:38,294
and peep about
to find ourselves dishonorable graves.

160
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,427
Men at some time are masters
of their fates.

161
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:46,601
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,

162
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:49,568
but in ourselves, that we are underlings.

163
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:51,332
Brutus and Caesar.

164
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,272
What should be in that Caesar?

165
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:55,540
Why should that name be sounded
more than yours?

166
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:57,582
Write them together,
yours is as fair a name.

167
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,549
Sound them,
it doth become the mouth as well.

168
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:01,984
Weigh them, it is as heavy.
Conjure with them,

169
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:05,046
Brutus will start a spirit
as soon as Caesar.

170
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:08,025
Now, in the name of all the gods at once,

171
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:10,790
upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,

172
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:13,230
that he is grown so great?

173
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,099
Age, thou art shamed!

174
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:19,764
Rome, thou hast lost
the breed of noble bloods.

175
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,733
When went there by a time,
since the great flood,

176
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,573
but it was famed
for more than for one man?

177
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:27,705
When could they say, till now,
that talked of Rome,

178
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,774
that her wide walls encompassed
but one man?

179
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,982
O you and I have heard our fathers say,
there was a Brutus once

180
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,086
that would have brooked the eternal devil

181
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,060
to keep his state in Rome
as easily as a king.

182
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:44,554
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.

183
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,760
What you would work me to,
I have some aim.

184
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,302
How I have thought of this
and of these times

185
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,998
I shall recount hereafter.

186
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:52,131
For this present,

187
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,075
I would not, so with love I might
entreat you, be any further moved.

188
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,406
What you have said I will consider.

189
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:01,848
What you have to say, I will with patience
hear and find a time both meet to hear

190
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,748
and answer such high things.

191
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:08,055
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this.

192
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,356
Brutus had rather be a villager

193
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,920
than to repute himself a son of Rome
under these hard conditions

194
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:17,488
as this time is like to lay upon us.

195
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,427
I am glad that my weak words

196
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:24,431
have struck but thus much show
of fire from Brutus.

197
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,642
The games are done
and Caesar is returning.

198
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:50,125
Look you, Cassius, the angry spot
doth glow on Caesar's brow,

199
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,099
and all the rest look like a chidden train.

200
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,800
Casca will, after his sour fashion, tell us
what hath proceeded worthy note today.

201
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,142
Calpurnia's cheek is pale,

202
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:02,510
and Cicero looks with such ferret
and such fiery eyes

203
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,312
as we have seen him in the Capitol being
crossed in conference by some senators.

204
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:09,013
Casca will tell us what the matter is.

205
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:24,436
Antonius, let me have men about me
that are fat,

206
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,200
sleek-headed men,
and such as sleep a-nights.

207
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:32,178
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much.

208
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:34,778
Such men are dangerous.

209
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,982
Fear him not, Caesar. He is not dangerous.

210
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,284
Would he were fatter.

211
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:44,281
But I fear him not.

212
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,292
Yet if my name were liable to fear,

213
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,023
I do not know the man I should avoid
so soon as that spare Cassius.

214
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:51,763
He reads much.

215
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:56,125
He is a great observer, and he looks
quite through the deeds of men.

216
00:15:57,004 --> 00:16:00,065
He loves no plays as thou dost, Antony.

217
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,040
He hears no music.

218
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,805
Seldom he smiles,
and smiles in such a sort

219
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,814
as if he mocked himself,
and scorned his spirit

220
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,373
that could be moved to smile at anything.

221
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,117
Such men as he be never at heart's ease

222
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:15,123
whilst they behold
a greater than themselves,

223
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,819
and therefore are they very dangerous.

224
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,026
I rather tell thee what is to be
feared than what I fear,

225
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:25,329
for always I am Caesar.

226
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,837
Come on my right hand,
for this ear is deaf, and tell me truly

227
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,898
what thou think'st of him.

228
00:16:57,869 --> 00:17:00,064
- Would you speak with me?
- Ay, Casca.

229
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:03,370
Tell us what hath chanced today,
that Caesar looks so sad.

230
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:06,205
Why, you were with him, were you not?

231
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:09,342
I should not then ask Casca
what had chanced.

232
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:13,114
Why, there was a crown offered him,
and, being offered him,

233
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:15,813
he put it by
with the back of his hand, thus,

234
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:18,152
and then the people fell a-shouting.

235
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,987
What was the second noise for?

236
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,459
- Why, for that too.
- They shouted thrice.

237
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:25,623
- What was the last cry for?
- Why, for that too.

238
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:29,095
- Was the crown offered him thrice?
- Ay, marry, it was,

239
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:32,604
and he put it by thrice,
every time gentler than other,

240
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,500
and with every putting by
mine honest neighbors shouted.

241
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:38,568
- Who offered him the crown?
- Why, Antony.

242
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:42,781
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

243
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,818
I can as well be hanged
as tell the manner of it.

244
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:47,548
It was mere foolery. I did not mark it.

245
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:49,681
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown.

246
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:52,988
Yet it was not a crown neither,
it was one of those coronets.

247
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:55,929
And as I told you, he put it by once,
but, for all that, to my thinking,

248
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,430
he would fain have had it.

249
00:17:57,498 --> 00:18:00,127
Then he offered it to him again,
then he put it by again,

250
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:03,433
but, to my thinking, he was very loath
to lay his fingers off it.

251
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:06,997
Then he offered it a third time.
He put it a third time by.

252
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:10,239
And still as he refused it, the rabblement
hooted and clapped their chapped hands

253
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,212
and threw up their sweaty nightcaps

254
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:15,512
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath
because Caesar refused the crown,

255
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:18,884
that it had almost choked Caesar
for he swounded and fell down at it.

256
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:21,480
And for mine own part I durst not laugh,
for fear of opening my lips

257
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:23,253
and receiving the bad air.

258
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,826
What? Did Caesar swoon?

259
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:29,160
He fell down and foamed at the mouth
and was speechless.

260
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:33,662
'Tis very like he hath the falling sickness.

261
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,331
No, Caesar hath it not,

262
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,675
but you and I and honest Casca,
we have the falling sickness.

263
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,244
I know not what you mean by that,
but I am sure Caesar fell down.

264
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,320
What said he when he came unto himself?

265
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:50,877
When he came to himself again,

266
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:53,390
he said if he had done
or said anything amiss,

267
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:56,586
he desired their worships
to think it was his infirmity.

268
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:59,862
Three or four wenches where I stood
cried, "Alas, good soul,"

269
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,330
and forgave him with all their hearts.

270
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,061
There's no heed to be taken of them.

271
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:07,503
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers,
they would have done no less.

272
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:10,336
And after that he came, thus sad, away?

273
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:11,741
Ay.

274
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,243
Did Cicero say anything?

275
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:15,576
- Ay, he spoke Greek.
- To what effect?

276
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,409
Nay, an I tell you that,
I'll never look you in the face again,

277
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:21,419
but those that understood him smiled
at one another and shook their heads,

278
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,751
but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.

279
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:25,814
I could tell you more news, too.

280
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:30,654
Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves
off Caesar's images, are put to silence.

281
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,489
Fare you well.

282
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,366
There was more foolery yet,
if I could remember it.

283
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:43,106
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?

284
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:45,508
No, I am promised forth.

285
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,446
Will you dine with me tomorrow?

286
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:54,818
Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold,
and your dinner worth the eating.

287
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,982
Good. I will expect you.

288
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,659
Do so. Farewell, both.

289
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,531
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be.

290
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,398
He was quick metal
when he went to school.

291
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:10,734
So is he now in execution
of any bold or noble enterprise.

292
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,165
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,

293
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:18,236
which gives men stomach to digest
his words with better appetite.

294
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:20,683
And so it is.

295
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,348
For this time I will leave you.

296
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,979
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you.

297
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:29,651
Or, if you will, come home to me,
and I will wait for you.

298
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:33,421
I will do so. Till then, think of the world.

299
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,933
Well, Brutus, thou art noble,

300
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:44,872
yet I see thy honorable metal
may be wrought from that it is disposed.

301
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,244
Therefore, it is meet that noble minds
keep ever with their likes,

302
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:52,077
for who so firm that cannot be seduced?

303
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,618
Caesar doth bear me hard,
yet he loves Brutus.

304
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:01,993
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
he should not humor me.

305
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,158
I will this night, in several hands,

306
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,667
in at his windows throw,
as if they came from several citizens,

307
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:14,035
writings all tending to the great opinion
that Rome holds of his name,

308
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:19,067
wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition
shall be glanced at.

309
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,510
And after this let Caesar seat him sure,

310
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,545
for we will shake him,

311
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,278
or worse days endure.

312
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:32,777
Good even, Casca.

313
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:35,548
Why are you breathless?
And why stare you so?

314
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:39,822
Are not you moved, when all the sway
of earth shakes like a thing unfirm?

315
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:41,296
O Cicero, I have seen tempests,

316
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:43,731
when the scolding winds have rived
the knotty oaks,

317
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:46,235
and I have seen the ambitious
ocean swell and rage and foam,

318
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,431
to be exalted with the threatening clouds.

319
00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:52,670
But never till tonight, never till now,
did I go through a tempest dropping fire.

320
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,609
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,

321
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,637
or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
incenses them to send destruction.

322
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,082
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?

323
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:03,484
A common slave,
you know him well by sight,

324
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:04,714
held up his left hand,

325
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,884
which did flame and burn
like 20 torches joined.

326
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,187
And there were drawn upon a heap

327
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,990
100 ghastly women,
transformed with their fear,

328
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:15,659
who swore they saw men all in fire
walk up and down the streets.

329
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:19,033
And yesterday the bird of night did sit,
even at noonday, upon the marketplace,

330
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:20,332
hooting and shrieking.

331
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,636
When these prodigies
do so conjointly meet,

332
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,769
let not men say, "These are their reasons,
they are natural."

333
00:23:25,845 --> 00:23:30,213
For, I believe, they are portentous things
unto the climate that they point upon.

334
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,711
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?

335
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:42,321
He doth, for he did bid Antonius send word
to you he would be there tomorrow.

336
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,261
Good night then, Casca.

337
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:47,561
This disturbed sky is not to walk in.

338
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:49,592
Farewell, Cicero.

339
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,991
- Who's there?
- A Roman.

340
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:14,790
Casca, by your voice.

341
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:19,061
- Cassius, what night is this?
- A very pleasing night to honest men.

342
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,658
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

343
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,433
Those that have known
the earth so full of faults.

344
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:25,201
You are dull, Casca,

345
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:27,504
and those sparks of life
that should be in a Roman

346
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,909
you do want, or else you use not.

347
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:33,449
You look pale and gaze and put on fear
and cast yourself in wonder,

348
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:36,451
to see the strange impatience
of the heavens.

349
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:41,658
Now could I, Casca, name to thee
a man most like this dreadful night

350
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:45,491
that thunders, lightens,
opens graves and roars.

351
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:48,190
A man no mightier than thyself or me.

352
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,028
'Tis Caesar that you mean,
is it not, Cassius?

353
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,089
Let it be who it is.

354
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:54,661
Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
mean to establish Caesar as a king.

355
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:56,865
And he shall wear his crown
by sea and land,

356
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,932
in every place save here in Italy.

357
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,410
I know where I will wear this dagger, then.

358
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:04,277
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.

359
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,681
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.

360
00:25:07,752 --> 00:25:10,277
So can I, so every bondman
in his own hand

361
00:25:10,356 --> 00:25:13,086
bears the power to cancel his captivity.

362
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:16,393
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?

363
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:19,329
Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf

364
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:21,889
but that he knows
the Romans are but sheep.

365
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:25,232
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.

366
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,372
They that with haste will make
a mighty fire begin it with weak straws.

367
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:33,442
What trash is Rome,
what rubbish and what offal,

368
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:36,243
that it serves for the base
matter to illuminate

369
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:38,715
so vile a thing as Caesar.

370
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,917
But, O grief, where hast thou led me?

371
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,216
I, per chance, speak this
before a willing bondman.

372
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:51,625
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
that is no fleering tell-tale.

373
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,199
Here's my hand.

374
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,929
And I will set this foot of mine
as far as who goes farthest.

375
00:25:56,003 --> 00:25:57,800
There's a bargain made!

376
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:00,806
Stand close awhile.

377
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:05,904
'Tis Cinna. I do know him by his gait.
He is a friend.

378
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:11,217
- Cinna, where haste you so?
- To find out you.

379
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,719
Who's that? Metellus Cimber?

380
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,051
No, it is Casca,
one incorporate to our attempts.

381
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,490
- Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
- Yes, you are.

382
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,494
Cassius, if you could but win the noble
Brutus to our party...

383
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:23,622
Be you content.
Good Cinna, take this paper,

384
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,566
and look you lay it in the praetor's
chair, where Brutus may but find it,

385
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:30,732
and throw this in at his window,
set this up in wax upon old Brutus' statue.

386
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:33,776
All this done, repair to Pompey's porch,
where you shall find us.

387
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,640
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

388
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:39,273
All but Metellus Cimber,
and he's gone to seek you at your house.

389
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,610
Now, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
seek Brutus at his house.

390
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,719
Three parts of him is ours already,

391
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,485
and the man entire
upon the next encounter yields him ours.

392
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:34,733
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
give guess how near to day.

393
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:43,110
Lucius.

394
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:47,719
Awake, I say. Lucius.

395
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:55,821
I would it were my fault
to sleep so soundly.

396
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:05,762
Called you, my lord?

397
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,606
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

398
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:11,235
I will, my lord.

399
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,827
It must be by his death,

400
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:33,931
and, for my part, I know no personal cause
to spurn at him but for the general.

401
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,803
He would be crowned.

402
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:40,843
How that might change his nature,
there's the question.

403
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,401
For it is the bright day
that brings forth the adder,

404
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,573
and that craves wary walking.

405
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:48,146
Crown him. That.

406
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:53,455
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
that at his will he may do danger with.

407
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:59,054
The abuse of greatness is
when it disjoins remorse from power.

408
00:29:00,264 --> 00:29:01,663
And, to speak truth of Caesar,

409
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:05,168
I have not known when his affections
swayed more than his reason.

410
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:09,969
But 'tis a common proof
that lowliness is young ambition's ladder,

411
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:12,902
whereto the climber upward turns
his face,

412
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,572
but when he once attains
the upmost round,

413
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:18,946
he then unto the ladder turns his back,
looks in the clouds,

414
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:23,049
scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend.

415
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:25,512
So Caesar may.

416
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,360
Then lest he may, prevent.

417
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,696
And, since the quarrel will bear no color
for the thing he is, fashion it thus,

418
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:38,960
that what he is, augmented,
would run to these and these extremities.

419
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,937
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg

420
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,838
which, hatched, would, as his kind,
grow mischievous,

421
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,347
and kill him in the shell.

422
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,854
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

423
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:02,555
Searching the window for a flint,
I found this paper thus sealed up,

424
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:05,530
and I am sure it did not lie there
when I went to bed.

425
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,465
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

426
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:08,559
I know not, sir.

427
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:12,094
- Look in the calendar and bring me word.
- I will, sir.

428
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,380
"Brutus, thou sleep'st.

429
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:21,882
"Awake and see thyself.

430
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:25,019
"Shall Rome, etcetera."

431
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:28,156
"Speak, strike, redress!

432
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,452
"Brutus, thou sleep'st. Awake!"

433
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:36,325
Such instigations have been often dropped
where I have took them up.

434
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,991
"Shall Rome, etcetera."

435
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,793
Thus must I piece it out.

436
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:45,367
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?

437
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:46,941
What, Rome?

438
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:50,578
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
the Tarquin drive,

439
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,672
when he was called a king.

440
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,675
"Speak, strike, redress."

441
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,982
Am I entreated to speak and strike?

442
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,056
O Rome, I make thee promise.

443
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:05,793
If the redress will follow,
thou receivest thy full petition

444
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,660
at the hand of Brutus.

445
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,566
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.

446
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,630
'Tis good.

447
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,337
Go to the gate. Somebody knocks.

448
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:27,375
Since Cassius first did whet me
against Caesar, I have not slept.

449
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,320
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
and the first motion,

450
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,882
all the interim is like a phantasma,

451
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,028
or a hideous dream.

452
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,488
The genius and the mortal instruments
are then in council,

453
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:43,027
and the state of man,

454
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:47,095
like to a little kingdom,
suffers then the nature of an insurrection.

455
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,076
I fear we are too bold upon your rest.

456
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,980
Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you?

457
00:31:57,051 --> 00:31:59,542
I have been up this hour, awake all night.

458
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:02,054
Know I these men
that come along with you?

459
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:04,818
Yes, every one of them.
And no man here but honors you.

460
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:07,156
And every one doth wish
you had but that opinion of yourself

461
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:09,423
which every noble Roman bears of you.

462
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:10,897
This is Trebonius.

463
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:12,963
- He is welcome hither.
- This, Decius Brutus.

464
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,264
- He is welcome, too.
- This, Casca. This, Cinna.

465
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:18,170
- And this, Metellus Cimber.
- They are all welcome.

466
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:21,004
What watchful cares
do interpose themselves

467
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:23,102
betwixt your eyes and the night?

468
00:32:23,745 --> 00:32:25,645
Shall I entreat a word?

469
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:36,686
Here lies the east.
Doth not the day break here?

470
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:39,789
- No.
- O pardon, sir, it doth.

471
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:43,762
Yon gray lines that fret the clouds
are messengers of day.

472
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,165
You shall confess
that you are both deceived.

473
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:49,672
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises.

474
00:32:56,948 --> 00:33:00,576
- Give me your hands all over, one by one.
- And let us swear our resolution.

475
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:02,142
No, not an oath.

476
00:33:02,654 --> 00:33:06,350
If not the face of men, the sufferance
of our souls, the time's abuse,

477
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:08,585
if these be motives weak,
break off betimes,

478
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,594
and every man hence to his idle bed.

479
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:12,721
So let high-sighted tyranny range on

480
00:33:12,797 --> 00:33:14,731
till each man drop by lottery.

481
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:18,524
What need we any spur but our own cause
to prick us to redress?

482
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:21,271
What other bond than secret Romans
that have spoke the word

483
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:23,068
and will not palter?

484
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:25,503
What other oath
than honesty to honesty engaged,

485
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:28,046
that this shall be or we will fall for it?

486
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:30,872
Swear priests and cowards
and men cautelous,

487
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:35,044
old feeble carrions and such suffering
souls that welcome wrongs.

488
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:38,686
Unto bad causes swear
such creatures as men doubt,

489
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:41,855
but do not stain the even virtue
of our enterprise,

490
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:44,293
nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirit,

491
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:47,822
to think that or our cause
or our performance did need an oath.

492
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,935
But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?

493
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:52,902
I think he will stand very strong with us.

494
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:56,705
O let us have him, for his silver hairs
will purchase us a good opinion

495
00:33:56,777 --> 00:33:58,937
and buy men's voices
to commend our deeds.

496
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:00,844
Let us not leave him out.

497
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:04,475
O name him not. For he will never follow
anything that other men begin.

498
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:07,043
- Then leave him out.
- Indeed, he is not fit.

499
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,885
Shall no man else be touched
but only Caesar?

500
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,022
Decius, well urged.

501
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:17,092
I think it is not meet Mark Antony,
so well beloved of Caesar,

502
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:18,757
should outlive Caesar.

503
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,798
We shall find in him a shrewd contriver,

504
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:22,769
and, you know, his means,
if he improve them,

505
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:25,306
may well stretch so far as to annoy us all,

506
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:28,172
which to prevent,
let Antony and Caesar fall together.

507
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:30,940
Our course will seem too bloody,
Caius Cassius,

508
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:33,206
to cut the head off
and then hack the limbs,

509
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,511
like wrath in death and envy afterwards.

510
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:37,950
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.

511
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,717
Let us be sacrificers,
but not butchers, Caius.

512
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:44,154
We all stand up
against the spirit of Caesar.

513
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:46,752
And in the spirit of men there is no blood.

514
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:48,724
O that we then could come
by Caesar's spirit,

515
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:52,199
and not dismember Caesar.
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.

516
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:55,968
And, gentle friends,
let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.

517
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,534
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.

518
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:02,737
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,

519
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:05,908
for he can do no more than Caesar's arm
when Caesar's head is off.

520
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,211
Yet I do fear him,

521
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:10,947
- for the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar.
- Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.

522
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:13,922
If he love Caesar,
all that he can do is to himself.

523
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,150
Take thought and die for Caesar.

524
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:18,862
And that were much he should,
for he is given to sports,

525
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,488
to wildness and much company.

526
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,931
There is no fear in him. Let him not die,

527
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:25,629
for he will live and laugh at this hereafter.

528
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:28,063
'Tis time to part.
The morning comes upon us.

529
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,869
We'll leave you, Brutus.

530
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:35,680
But it is doubtful yet whether Caesar
will come forth today or no,

531
00:35:35,748 --> 00:35:38,216
for he is superstitious grown of late.

532
00:35:38,284 --> 00:35:41,447
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
the unaccustomed terror of the night,

533
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,580
and the persuasion of his augurers,
may hold him from the Capitol today.

534
00:35:44,658 --> 00:35:49,095
Never fear that.
If he be so resolved, I can oversway him,

535
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:53,096
for he loves to hear that unicorns may be
betrayed with trees,

536
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:56,294
lions with toils and men with flatterers.

537
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:59,030
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,

538
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:01,973
he says he does,
being then most flattered.

539
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:04,600
Let me work,
and I will bring him to the Capitol.

540
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:07,875
Nay, we will all of us be there
to fetch him.

541
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:12,114
By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?

542
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:14,416
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

543
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:16,923
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,

544
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,686
who rated him
for speaking well of Pompey.

545
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,387
I wonder none of you have thought of him.

546
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,156
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.

547
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,959
He loves me well,
and I have given him reasons.

548
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,364
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

549
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,996
And friends, disperse yourselves,
but all remember what you have said,

550
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:32,732
and show yourselves true Romans.

551
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:34,571
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.

552
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:36,941
Let not our looks put on our purposes.

553
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,080
And so, good morrow to you, everyone.

554
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:53,385
Portia, what mean you?
Wherefore rise you now?

555
00:36:54,264 --> 00:36:56,732
It is not for your health thus
to commit your weak condition

556
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,928
- to the raw cold morning.
- Nor for yours neither.

557
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:03,262
You've ungently, Brutus,
stole from my bed,

558
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:07,269
and yesternight at supper
you suddenly arose and walked about

559
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:09,778
musing and sighing
with your arms across.

560
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,404
And when I asked you
what the matter was,

561
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,849
you stared upon me with ungentle looks.

562
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:16,448
I urged you further,

563
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:20,213
and then you scratched your head and
too impatiently stamped with your foot.

564
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,192
Yet I insisted, yet you answered not,

565
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,128
but, with an angry wafture of your hand,
gave sign for me to leave you.

566
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:27,626
So I did,

567
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:31,834
fearing to strengthen that impatience
which seemed too much enkindled,

568
00:37:32,037 --> 00:37:34,597
and withal hoping it was
but an effect of humor,

569
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:37,199
which sometime hath his hour
with every man.

570
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:41,642
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep.

571
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:44,275
And, could it work
so much upon your shape

572
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,284
as it hath much prevailed
on your condition,

573
00:37:46,352 --> 00:37:48,411
I should not know you, Brutus.

574
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,451
Dear my lord, make me acquainted
with your cause of grief.

575
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:56,017
I am not well in health, and that is all.

576
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:59,063
Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,

577
00:37:59,132 --> 00:38:02,158
he would embrace the means
to come by it.

578
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,828
Why, so I do.

579
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,338
Good Portia, go to bed.

580
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:10,242
Is Brutus sick?

581
00:38:10,311 --> 00:38:12,336
And is it physical to walk unbraced

582
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:15,176
and suck up the humors
of the dank morning?

583
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:16,647
What, is Brutus sick?

584
00:38:16,718 --> 00:38:18,709
And will he steal
out of his wholesome bed

585
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:22,449
to dare the vile contagion of the night,
and add unto his sickness?

586
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,990
No, my Brutus.

587
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:27,926
You have some sick offense
within your mind,

588
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:31,955
which, by the right and virtue of my place,
I ought to know of.

589
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:34,800
And, upon my knees, I charm you

590
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:36,769
by my once-commended beauty,

591
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:38,999
by all your vows of love
and that great vow

592
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:41,235
which did incorporate and make us one,

593
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,144
that you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
why you are heavy,

594
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:49,281
and what men tonight
have had resort to you,

595
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:53,821
for here have been some six or seven who
did hide their faces even from darkness.

596
00:38:54,357 --> 00:38:56,257
Kneel not, gentle Portia.

597
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:58,954
I should not need
if you were gentle Brutus.

598
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,524
Within the bond of marriage,
tell me, Brutus,

599
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:06,233
is it excepted I should know no secrets
that appertain to you?

600
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:10,173
Am I yourself but, as it were,
in sort or limitation,

601
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:13,072
to keep with you at meals,
comfort your bed,

602
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:14,736
and talk to you sometimes.

603
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,613
Dwell I but in the suburbs
of your good pleasure?

604
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:22,944
If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot,
not his wife.

605
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:28,858
You are my true and honorable wife,

606
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:32,894
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
that visit my sad heart.

607
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:36,492
If this were true,
then should I know this secret.

608
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:38,702
I grant I am a woman,

609
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:41,568
but withal a woman
that Lord Brutus took to wife.

610
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,475
I grant I am a woman, but withal a woman
well-reputed, Cato's daughter.

611
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:51,143
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
being so fathered and so husbanded?

612
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:54,711
Tell me your counsels.
I will not disclose them.

613
00:39:57,658 --> 00:39:59,319
Portia, go in a while.

614
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:02,793
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
the secrets of my heart.

615
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,023
All my engagements
I will construe to thee,

616
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,567
all the charactery of my sad brows.

617
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:19,043
Here is a sick man
that would speak with you.

618
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:24,308
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.

619
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:25,510
Boy, stand aside.

620
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:28,112
Vouchsafe good morrow
from a feeble tongue.

621
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:31,716
What a time have you chose out,
brave Caius, to wear a kerchief.

622
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:34,690
- Would you were not sick.
- I am not sick,

623
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:38,096
if Brutus have in hand any exploit
worthy the name of honor.

624
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:40,032
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,

625
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,070
had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

626
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:45,903
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
I here discard my sickness.

627
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:49,068
Bid me run,
and I will strive with things impossible.

628
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,010
Yea, get the better of them.

629
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,844
For it sufficeth that Brutus leads me on.

630
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,484
What's to do?

631
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:59,214
A piece of work
that will make sick men whole.

632
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:02,118
But are not some whole
but we must make sick?

633
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:04,520
That must we also.

634
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,103
Caesar! Help!

635
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,974
Help!

636
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:30,516
They murder Caesar! They murder Caesar!

637
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,747
They murdered Caesar!

638
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,391
They murdered Caesar!

639
00:41:38,097 --> 00:41:39,758
Who's within?

640
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:42,261
Who's within?

641
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:44,927
My lord.

642
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:48,735
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
and bring me their opinions of success.

643
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,275
I will, my lord.

644
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,654
Nor heaven nor earth
have been at peace tonight.

645
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:15,531
What mean you, Caesar?

646
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,704
Think you to walk forth?

647
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:20,567
You shall not stir out of your house today.

648
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,465
Caesar shall forth.

649
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:25,044
The things that threatened me
never looked but at my back,

650
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:27,342
when they shall see the face of Caesar,
they are vanished.

651
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:28,780
Caesar,

652
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:31,681
I never stood on ceremonies.

653
00:42:32,154 --> 00:42:33,781
Yet now they fright me.

654
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:37,623
There is one within, besides
the things that we have heard and seen,

655
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:40,593
recounts most horrid sights
seen by the watch.

656
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,329
A lioness hath whelped in the streets,

657
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:47,434
and graves have yawned
and yielded up their dead.

658
00:42:47,803 --> 00:42:50,237
Fierce fiery warriors
fought upon the clouds,

659
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:53,571
and ghosts did shriek
and squeal about the streets.

660
00:42:55,178 --> 00:42:58,341
O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,

661
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:01,245
and I do fear them.

662
00:43:01,684 --> 00:43:03,174
Yet Caesar shall go forth,

663
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:06,620
for these predictions are to the world
in general as to Caesar.

664
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,353
When beggars die,
there are no comets seen.

665
00:43:10,627 --> 00:43:14,723
The heavens themselves
blaze forth the death of princes.

666
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:17,267
Cowards die many times
before their death.

667
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,929
The valiant never taste of death but once.

668
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:23,966
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,

669
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:26,943
it seems to me most strange
that men should fear,

670
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:30,446
seeing that death, a necessary end,
will come

671
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,179
when it will come.

672
00:43:36,055 --> 00:43:37,488
What say the augurers?

673
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:40,081
They would not have you
to stir forth today.

674
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,393
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,

675
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:45,021
they could not find
a heart within the beast.

676
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,631
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.

677
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:53,870
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
if he should stay at home today for fear.

678
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,601
No, Caesar shall not.

679
00:43:55,742 --> 00:43:58,643
Danger knows full well
that Caesar is more dangerous than he,

680
00:43:58,711 --> 00:44:00,737
and Caesar shall go forth!

681
00:44:01,114 --> 00:44:04,982
Alas, my lord, your wisdom
is consumed in confidence.

682
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,185
Do not go forth today.

683
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:12,023
Call it my fear that keeps you
in the house and not your own.

684
00:44:12,393 --> 00:44:14,451
We'll send Mark Antony
to the senate house,

685
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,325
and he shall say you are not well today.

686
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:20,533
Let me prevail in this.

687
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:24,996
Mark Antony shall say I am not well.

688
00:44:26,974 --> 00:44:30,137
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.

689
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:36,174
Here's Decius Brutus.
He shall tell them so.

690
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:40,419
Caesar, all hail!
Good morrow, worthy Caesar.

691
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,020
I come to fetch you to the senate house.

692
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:46,322
And you are come in very happy time
to bear my greeting to the senators,

693
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:48,796
and tell them that I will not come today.

694
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,558
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser.

695
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:54,292
I will not come today.
Tell them so, Decius.

696
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:57,231
- Say he is sick.
- Shall Caesar send a lie?

697
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,733
Have I in conquest
stretched mine arm so far

698
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:01,903
to be afeard to tell graybeards the truth?

699
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:04,503
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.

700
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:08,274
Most mighty Caesar,
let me know some cause,

701
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:11,213
lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.

702
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:14,115
The cause is in my will. I will not come.

703
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,386
That is enough to satisfy the senate.

704
00:45:17,394 --> 00:45:21,353
But, for your private satisfaction,
because I love you, I will let you know.

705
00:45:21,432 --> 00:45:23,958
Calpurnia here, my wife,
stays me at home.

706
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:26,762
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,

707
00:45:26,838 --> 00:45:31,172
which like a fountain with 100 spouts
did run pure blood.

708
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:34,639
And many lusty Romans came smiling

709
00:45:34,713 --> 00:45:37,511
and did bathe their hands in it.

710
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:42,450
And these does she apply for warnings
and portents and evils imminent,

711
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:45,820
and on her knee hath begged
that I will stay at home today.

712
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:53,526
This dream is all amiss interpreted.

713
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:57,034
It was a vision fair and fortunate.

714
00:45:57,503 --> 00:46:02,372
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
in which so many smiling Romans bathed,

715
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:05,208
signifies that, from you,

716
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:08,572
great Rome shall suck reviving blood,

717
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:13,017
and that great men shall press
for tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.

718
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,717
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

719
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:19,486
And this way have you well expounded it.

720
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,125
I have, when you have
heard what I can say.

721
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:23,788
And know it now.

722
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:27,628
The senate have concluded
to give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.

723
00:46:28,903 --> 00:46:30,666
If you shall send them word
you will not come,

724
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:32,729
their minds may change.

725
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:36,910
Besides, it were a mock apt
to be rendered for some one to say,

726
00:46:36,978 --> 00:46:39,879
"Break up the senate till another time,

727
00:46:40,115 --> 00:46:43,107
"when Caesar's wife
shall meet with better dreams."

728
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:44,846
If Caesar hide himself,

729
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,549
shall they not whisper,
"Lo, Caesar is afraid?"

730
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:49,884
Pardon me, Caesar,

731
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:53,122
for my dear, dear love to your proceeding
bids me tell you this,

732
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:55,494
and reason to my love is liable.

733
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:57,964
How foolish do your fears seem
now, Calpurnia!

734
00:46:58,033 --> 00:47:02,027
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go!

735
00:47:09,647 --> 00:47:12,377
And look where Publius
has come to fetch me.

736
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,917
- Good morrow, Caesar.
- Welcome, Publius.

737
00:47:16,153 --> 00:47:18,713
What, Brutus,
are you stirred so early, too?

738
00:47:19,122 --> 00:47:20,590
Good morrow, Casca.

739
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:23,684
Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne'er
so much your enemy

740
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:26,252
as that same ague
which hath made you lean.

741
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:29,194
- What is't o'clock?
- Caesar, 'tis after eight.

742
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,496
See. Antony, that revels long
o' nights is notwithstanding up.

743
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,638
- Good morrow, Antony.
- So to most noble Caesar.

744
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:45,408
I am to blame to be thus waited for.

745
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,447
Good friends, go in
and taste some wine with me,

746
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:51,149
and we, like friends,
will straightaway go together.

747
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:02,628
Now, Cinna.

748
00:48:02,702 --> 00:48:05,170
Now, Metellus. What, Trebonius!

749
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:07,767
I have an hour's talk in store for you.

750
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:10,105
Remember that you call on me today.

751
00:48:10,343 --> 00:48:14,178
- Be near me, that I may remember you.
- Caesar, I will.

752
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,182
"Caesar, beware of Brutus.

753
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,848
"Take heed of Cassius.
Come not near Casca.

754
00:48:54,924 --> 00:48:57,324
"Have an eye to Cinna.
Trust not Trebonius.

755
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,327
"Mark well Metellus Cimber.

756
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:04,728
"Decius Brutus loves thee not.
Thou has wronged Caius Ligarius.

757
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:10,029
"There is but one mind in all these men,
and it is bent against Caesar.

758
00:49:10,206 --> 00:49:12,640
"If thou be'st not immortal,
look about you.

759
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:15,371
"Security gives way to conspiracy.

760
00:49:16,147 --> 00:49:19,776
"The mighty gods defend thee.
Artemidorus."

761
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:37,327
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along.

762
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:41,597
If thou read this, O Caesar,
thou mayst live.

763
00:49:41,707 --> 00:49:45,870
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

764
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:05,020
The ides of March are come.

765
00:50:05,197 --> 00:50:07,792
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.

766
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:15,600
Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.

767
00:50:15,976 --> 00:50:19,343
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er-read,
at your best leisure, this his humble suit.

768
00:50:19,413 --> 00:50:20,846
O Caesar, read mine first.

769
00:50:20,913 --> 00:50:23,405
For mine's a suit that touches Caesar
nearer. Read it, great Caesar.

770
00:50:23,484 --> 00:50:25,714
What touches us ourself
shall be last served.

771
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:27,481
Delay not, Caesar, read it instantly.

772
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:29,249
What, is the fellow mad?

773
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,358
Sirrah, give place.

774
00:50:33,962 --> 00:50:36,088
What, urge you your petitions
in the street?

775
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:37,630
Come to the Capitol.

776
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:46,132
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.

777
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,334
- What enterprise, Popilius?
- Fare you well.

778
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:55,139
What said Popilius Lena?

779
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:57,117
He wished today
our enterprise might thrive.

780
00:50:57,186 --> 00:51:00,713
- I fear our purpose is discovered.
- Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.

781
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:05,522
Brutus, what shall be done?

782
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:08,995
If this be known, Cassius or Caesar
never shall turn back, for I will slay myself.

783
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,294
Cassius, be constant.

784
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,165
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,
for, look, he smiles,

785
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:15,261
and Caesar doth not change.

786
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,706
Trebonius knows his time,
for, look you, Brutus,

787
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,972
he draws Mark Antony out of the way.

788
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:49,935
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
and presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

789
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:53,443
He is addressed.
Press near and second him.

790
00:51:57,483 --> 00:52:00,783
Casca, you are the first
that rears your hand.

791
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:11,888
Are we all ready?

792
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:15,659
What is now amiss that Caesar
and his senate must redress?

793
00:52:15,735 --> 00:52:18,533
Most high, most mighty,
and most puissant Caesar,

794
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:21,939
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
an humble heart.

795
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:23,567
I must prevent thee, Cimber.

796
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,873
These couchings
and these lowly courtesies

797
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:30,042
might fire the blood of ordinary men,
and turn pre-ordinance and first decree

798
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:31,846
into the law of children.

799
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:35,822
Be not fond to think
that Caesar bears such rebel blood

800
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:39,757
that will be thawed from the true quality
by that which melteth fools.

801
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,585
I mean sweet words,

802
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:45,097
low-crooked courtesies
and base spaniel fawning.

803
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:48,927
Thy brother by decree is banished.

804
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:51,870
If thou dost bend and pray
and fawn for him,

805
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,466
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.

806
00:52:55,143 --> 00:52:58,978
Know, Caesar doth not wrong,
nor without cause will he be satisfied.

807
00:52:59,048 --> 00:53:01,038
Is there no voice
more worthy than my own

808
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:03,415
to sound more sweetly
in great Caesar's ear

809
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:05,886
for the repealing of my banished brother?

810
00:53:06,189 --> 00:53:09,056
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,

811
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:12,561
desiring thee that Publius Cimber
may have an immediate freedom of repeal.

812
00:53:12,628 --> 00:53:13,994
What, Brutus?

813
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:16,357
Pardon, Caesar. Caesar, pardon.

814
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:18,366
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,

815
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:20,869
to beg enfranchisement
for Publius Cimber.

816
00:53:20,938 --> 00:53:23,270
I could be well moved if I were as you.

817
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:26,036
If I could pray to move,
prayers would move me.

818
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,542
But I am constant as the northern star,

819
00:53:28,812 --> 00:53:32,874
of whose true fixed and resting quality
there is no fellow in the firmament.

820
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:35,111
The skies are painted
with unnumbered sparks.

821
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:37,619
They are all fire and every one doth shine,

822
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:40,556
but there's but one in all
doth hold his place.

823
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:45,355
So in the world,
'tis furnished well with men,

824
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,024
and men are flesh and blood,
and apprehensive,

825
00:53:48,499 --> 00:53:50,990
yet in the number I do know but one,

826
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:54,629
that unassailable holds on his rank,
unshaked of motion,

827
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:58,203
and that I am he.
Let me a little show it, even in this.

828
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,472
That I was constant
Cimber should be banished,

829
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:02,844
and constant do remain to keep him so.

830
00:54:02,915 --> 00:54:04,383
- O, Caesar!
- Hence!

831
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,418
- Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
- Great Caesar!

832
00:54:06,485 --> 00:54:10,046
- Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
- Speak, hands, for me!

833
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:51,330
<i>Et tu, Brute? Then fall Caesar.</i>

834
00:54:57,205 --> 00:54:58,467
Liberty! Freedom!

835
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,932
Tyranny is dead!

836
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:02,272
Run hence!
Proclaim, cry it about the streets!

837
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:06,873
Some to the common pulpits and cry out,
"Liberty, freedom, enfranchisement!"

838
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,316
People and Senators, be not affrighted.

839
00:55:09,485 --> 00:55:13,785
Fly not, stand still.
Ambition's debt is paid.

840
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:16,250
- Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
- Where's Publius?

841
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,726
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

842
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:21,229
Stand fast together, lest some
friend of Caesar's should chance to...

843
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:23,424
Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer.

844
00:55:23,499 --> 00:55:26,367
There is no harm intended to your person,
nor to no Roman else.

845
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:28,029
So tell them, Publius.

846
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:31,841
- Where is Antony?
- Fled to his house amazed.

847
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:35,675
Men, wives and children stare,
cry out and run, as it were doomsday!

848
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,040
Now leave us, Publius.

849
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:40,413
Lest that the people, rushing on us,
should do your age some mischief.

850
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:43,851
Do so, and let no man abide this deed,
but we the doers.

851
00:55:57,635 --> 00:55:59,830
Fates, we will know your pleasures.

852
00:56:00,706 --> 00:56:03,105
That we shall die, we know.

853
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:06,536
'Tis but the time and drawing days out
that men stand upon.

854
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:10,946
Why, he that cuts off 20 years of life,
cuts off so many years of fearing death.

855
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:16,178
Grant that, and then is death a benefit.

856
00:56:16,555 --> 00:56:20,959
So we, Caesar's friends, that have
abridged his time of fearing death.

857
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:27,330
Stoop, Romans, stoop, and let us
bathe our hands in Caesar's blood.

858
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,759
How many ages hence shall
this our lofty scene be acted over,

859
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,564
in states unborn and accents yet unknown.

860
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:38,037
How many times shall
Caesar bleed in sport,

861
00:56:38,846 --> 00:56:42,839
that now on Pompey's basis lies along
no worthier than the dust.

862
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,076
So oft as that shall be,

863
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:49,590
so often shall the knot of us be called
the men that gave their country liberty.

864
00:57:01,036 --> 00:57:03,004
Soft, who comes here?

865
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:06,336
A friend of Antony's.

866
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:11,575
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel.

867
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:13,774
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down.

868
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,318
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say,

869
00:57:16,953 --> 00:57:19,819
"Brutus is noble, wise, valiant and honest.

870
00:57:20,323 --> 00:57:22,918
"Caesar was mighty, bold,
royal and loving.

871
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:25,486
"Say I love Brutus and I honor him.

872
00:57:26,063 --> 00:57:28,758
"Say I feared Caesar,
honored him and loved him.

873
00:57:29,732 --> 00:57:33,328
"If Brutus will vouchsafe that
Antony may safely come to him

874
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:36,969
"and be resolved how Caesar
hath deserved to lie in death,

875
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:40,802
"Mark Antony shall not love
Caesar dead so well as Brutus living,

876
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:43,974
"but will follow the fortunes
and affairs of noble Brutus

877
00:57:44,049 --> 00:57:46,448
"through the hazards of this untrod state

878
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:48,075
"with all true faith."

879
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:50,749
So says my master Antony.

880
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:55,490
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.
I never thought him worse.

881
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:59,087
Tell him, so please him come
unto this place, he shall be satisfied,

882
00:57:59,164 --> 00:58:01,928
and, by my honor, depart untouched.

883
00:58:02,668 --> 00:58:04,397
I'll fetch him presently.

884
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,740
I know that we shall have him well
to friend.

885
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:11,037
I wish we may.

886
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:13,234
And yet I have a mind
that fears him much,

887
00:58:13,312 --> 00:58:16,372
and my misgiving still fall
shrewdly to the purpose.

888
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:44,275
Welcome, Mark Antony.

889
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:00,260
O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low?

890
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:05,127
Are all thy conquests, glories,
triumphs, spoils,

891
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:07,294
shrunk to this little measure?

892
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:10,530
Fare thee well.

893
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:18,376
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,

894
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:21,110
who else must be let blood,
who else is rank.

895
00:59:21,451 --> 00:59:25,251
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
as Caesar's death hour,

896
00:59:25,822 --> 00:59:28,882
nor no instrument of half that worth
as those your swords,

897
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:31,985
made rich with the most
noble blood of all this world.

898
00:59:32,395 --> 00:59:34,260
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

899
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:38,200
now, whilst your purpled hands do reek
and smoke, fulfill your pleasure.

900
00:59:39,302 --> 00:59:42,932
Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die.

901
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,641
No place will please me so,
no mean of death, as here by Caesar,

902
00:59:48,246 --> 00:59:49,679
and by you cut off,

903
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:53,675
the choice and master spirits of this age.

904
00:59:55,988 --> 00:59:58,479
O Antony, beg not your death of us.

905
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,150
Though now we must appear
bloody and cruel,

906
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:03,558
as by our hands and this our
present act, you see we do,

907
01:00:03,629 --> 01:00:06,996
yet see you but our hands and this
the bleeding business they have done,

908
01:00:07,066 --> 01:00:08,727
our hearts you see not.

909
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:12,503
They are pitiful.
And pity to the general wrong of Rome,

910
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:16,029
as fire drives out fire, so pity, pity,
hath done this deed on Caesar.

911
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:19,567
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
in the disposing of new dignities.

912
01:00:19,646 --> 01:00:21,705
Only be patient
till we have appeased the multitude

913
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:23,248
beside themselves with fear.

914
01:00:23,316 --> 01:00:25,808
And then we will deliver you
the cause why I,

915
01:00:25,885 --> 01:00:29,151
that did love Caesar when I struck him,
have thus proceeded.

916
01:00:29,223 --> 01:00:31,020
I doubt not of your wisdom.

917
01:00:31,492 --> 01:00:33,789
Let each man render me his bloody hand.

918
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:36,929
First, Marcus Brutus, do I shake with you.

919
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:40,266
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.

920
01:00:42,037 --> 01:00:44,129
Now, Decius Brutus, yours.

921
01:00:45,473 --> 01:00:47,304
Yours, Metellus.

922
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:49,732
Yours, Cinna.

923
01:00:50,345 --> 01:00:52,540
And my valiant Casca, yours.

924
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:57,647
Though last, not least in love,
yours, good Trebonius.

925
01:01:04,392 --> 01:01:05,951
Gentlemen all.

926
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,860
Alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands

927
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:11,832
on such slippery ground,
that one of two bad ways

928
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:15,894
you must conceit me,
either a coward or a flatterer.

929
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:21,567
That I did love thee, Caesar, O it is true.

930
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:24,504
If then thy spirit look upon us now,

931
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,811
shall it not grieve thee dearer
than thy death

932
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,044
to see thy Antony making his peace,

933
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:33,788
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
most noble in the presence of thy corse?

934
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:37,218
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,

935
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,820
weeping as fast
as they stream forth thy blood,

936
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:44,300
it would become me better than to close
in terms of friendship with thine enemies.

937
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:47,934
- Mark Antony?
- Pardon me, Caius Cassius.

938
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:51,706
The enemies of Caesar shall say this.

939
01:01:51,776 --> 01:01:54,074
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

940
01:01:54,413 --> 01:01:56,710
I blame you not for praising Caesar so,

941
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:59,249
but what compact mean you
to have with us?

942
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:01,009
Will you be pricked in number
of our friends,

943
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:02,518
or shall we on, and not depend on you?

944
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:04,488
Therefore I took your hands,

945
01:02:05,457 --> 01:02:09,018
but was indeed swayed from the point
by looking down on Caesar.

946
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:12,520
Friends am I with you all and love you all.

947
01:02:13,065 --> 01:02:14,590
Upon this hope

948
01:02:15,434 --> 01:02:19,201
that you shall give me reasons
why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.

949
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:22,002
Or else were this a savage spectacle.

950
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,400
Our reasons are so full of good regard

951
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:27,708
that were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
you should be satisfied.

952
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:29,180
That's all I seek,

953
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:33,417
and am moreover suitor that I may
produce his body to the marketplace,

954
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:37,512
and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
speak in the order of his funeral.

955
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:41,024
- You shall, Mark Antony.
- Brutus, a word with you.

956
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:48,563
Do not consent that Antony
speak in his funeral.

957
01:02:48,636 --> 01:02:50,399
Know you how much
the people may be moved

958
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:52,633
- by that which he will utter?
- By your pardon,

959
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:56,074
I will myself into the pulpit first, and
show the reason of our Caesar's death.

960
01:02:56,144 --> 01:02:59,443
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
he speaks by leave and by permission,

961
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:02,915
and that we are contented Caesar shall
have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.

962
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:05,145
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

963
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,246
I know not what may fall. I like it not.

964
01:03:14,864 --> 01:03:18,857
Mark Antony, here,
take you Caesar's body.

965
01:03:19,435 --> 01:03:22,063
You shall not in your funeral speech
blame us,

966
01:03:22,338 --> 01:03:24,329
but speak all good
you can devise of Caesar,

967
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:26,568
and say you do it by our permission.

968
01:03:26,642 --> 01:03:29,509
Else shall you not have any
hand at all about his funeral,

969
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,047
and you shall speak in the same pulpit
whereto I am going

970
01:03:32,115 --> 01:03:33,844
after my speech is ended.

971
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:37,518
Be it so. I do desire no more.

972
01:04:49,697 --> 01:04:52,666
O, pardon me,
thou bleeding piece of earth,

973
01:04:53,402 --> 01:04:56,598
that I am meek and gentle
with these butchers.

974
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:03,938
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
that ever lived in the tide of times.

975
01:05:07,716 --> 01:05:11,413
Woe to the hand
that shed this costly blood.

976
01:05:13,355 --> 01:05:16,222
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,

977
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:19,528
which like dumb mouths
do ope their ruby lips

978
01:05:19,595 --> 01:05:22,121
to beg the voice
and utterance of my tongue,

979
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:25,964
a curse shall light upon the limbs of men.

980
01:05:27,102 --> 01:05:31,200
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall
cumber all the parts of Italy.

981
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:35,674
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
and dreadful objects so familiar,

982
01:05:35,745 --> 01:05:38,271
that mothers shall but smile
when they behold their infants

983
01:05:38,349 --> 01:05:39,907
quartered with the hands of war.

984
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:42,976
All pity choked with custom of fell deed.

985
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:44,912
And Caesar's spirit,

986
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:49,923
ranging for revenge,
with Ate by his side come hot from hell,

987
01:05:50,428 --> 01:05:54,694
shall in these confines
with a monarch's voice cry "Havoc!"

988
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:59,401
And let slip the dogs of war.

989
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:05,106
That this foul deed shall smell
above the earth

990
01:06:05,944 --> 01:06:09,107
with carrion men, groaning for burial.

991
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,424
Caesar!

992
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:44,274
Romans!

993
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:47,286
Countrymen!

994
01:06:51,726 --> 01:06:54,889
I will hear Brutus speak!

995
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,723
Hear me for my cause!

996
01:06:58,966 --> 01:07:02,903
Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks!

997
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:06,335
Romans,

998
01:07:07,075 --> 01:07:08,667
countrymen,

999
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:10,810
be patient till the last!

1000
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,241
Hear me for my cause,
and be silent, that you may hear.

1001
01:07:15,751 --> 01:07:17,981
Believe me for mine honor,

1002
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:21,352
and have respect to mine honor,
that you may believe.

1003
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:24,582
Censure me in your wisdom,
and awake your senses,

1004
01:07:24,661 --> 01:07:26,322
that you may the better judge.

1005
01:07:26,396 --> 01:07:27,726
Caesar! Caesar!

1006
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:29,662
Caesar!

1007
01:07:35,405 --> 01:07:37,966
If there be any in this assembly,

1008
01:07:38,074 --> 01:07:40,600
any dear friend of Caesar's,

1009
01:07:41,044 --> 01:07:44,913
to him I say that Brutus' love
to Caesar was no less than his.

1010
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:50,276
If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar,

1011
01:07:50,454 --> 01:07:52,319
this is my answer.

1012
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:57,320
Not that I loved Caesar less,
but that I loved Rome more.

1013
01:07:58,129 --> 01:08:01,565
Had you rather Caesar were living,
and die all slaves,

1014
01:08:01,866 --> 01:08:05,962
than that Caesar were dead,
to live all free men?

1015
01:08:06,036 --> 01:08:07,629
- No!
- No!

1016
01:08:07,973 --> 01:08:09,372
- No!
- No!

1017
01:08:11,309 --> 01:08:14,938
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him.

1018
01:08:15,181 --> 01:08:17,876
As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it.

1019
01:08:17,984 --> 01:08:20,383
As he was valiant, I honor him.

1020
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:24,355
But as he was ambitious, I slew him.

1021
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:28,525
There's tears for his love,
joy for his fortune,

1022
01:08:28,594 --> 01:08:33,224
honor for his valor,
and death for his ambition.

1023
01:08:35,268 --> 01:08:38,203
Who is here so base
that will be a bondsman?

1024
01:08:38,772 --> 01:08:41,036
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1025
01:08:41,475 --> 01:08:44,842
Who is here so rude
that would not be a Roman?

1026
01:08:45,212 --> 01:08:47,612
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1027
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:53,410
Who is here so vile
that will not love his country?

1028
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:56,921
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1029
01:08:57,891 --> 01:08:59,951
I pause for a reply.

1030
01:09:06,701 --> 01:09:08,328
None, Brutus. None!

1031
01:09:08,403 --> 01:09:09,461
None!

1032
01:09:09,537 --> 01:09:11,130
- None!
- None!

1033
01:09:11,806 --> 01:09:13,797
- None!
- None!

1034
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:16,208
Then none have I offended.

1035
01:09:16,845 --> 01:09:20,543
I have done no more to Caesar
than you shall do to Brutus.

1036
01:09:22,017 --> 01:09:24,884
The question of his death
is enrolled in the Capitol.

1037
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:27,787
His glory not extenuated,
wherein he was worthy,

1038
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:30,186
nor his offenses enforced,

1039
01:09:30,326 --> 01:09:32,521
for which he suffered death.

1040
01:09:53,484 --> 01:09:55,611
Here comes his body,

1041
01:09:55,753 --> 01:09:57,584
mourned by Mark Antony,

1042
01:09:58,356 --> 01:10:02,850
who, though he had no hand in his death,
shall receive the benefit of his dying,

1043
01:10:03,094 --> 01:10:07,588
a place in the commonwealth,
as which of you shall not?

1044
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:11,064
With this I depart.

1045
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,165
That, as I slew Caesar
for the good of Rome,

1046
01:10:15,774 --> 01:10:19,210
I have the same dagger for myself,

1047
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:22,537
when it shall please my country
to need my death.

1048
01:10:22,614 --> 01:10:24,741
- Live, Brutus!
- Live! Live!

1049
01:10:24,816 --> 01:10:27,047
- Live!
- Live!

1050
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:39,393
Bring him with triumph
home unto his house!

1051
01:10:39,466 --> 01:10:42,696
- Give him a statue with his ancestors!
- Live, Brutus!

1052
01:10:42,769 --> 01:10:43,793
- Live!
- Live!

1053
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:46,065
Let him be Caesar!

1054
01:10:46,139 --> 01:10:49,575
Caesar's better parts
shall be crowned in Brutus!

1055
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,007
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

1056
01:10:53,914 --> 01:10:56,314
- Good countrymen.
- Peace! Silence!

1057
01:10:56,383 --> 01:10:58,214
Brutus speaks!

1058
01:10:59,153 --> 01:11:02,351
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,

1059
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:05,286
and for my sake, stay here with Antony.

1060
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,126
Do grace to Caesar's corpse,

1061
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:11,626
and grace his speech
tending to Caesar's glories,

1062
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:15,224
which Mark Antony, by our permission,
is allowed to make.

1063
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:18,104
I do entreat you, not a man depart,

1064
01:11:18,473 --> 01:11:21,033
save I alone, till Antony hath spoke.

1065
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,050
Stay, ho! Let us hear Mark Antony!

1066
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:32,019
Let him go up into the public chair.
We'll hear him.

1067
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,952
Noble Antony, go up.

1068
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:37,486
For Brutus' sake, I am beholden to you.

1069
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:39,424
What does he say of Brutus?

1070
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:43,694
He says for Brutus' sake,
he finds himself beholding to us all.

1071
01:12:01,252 --> 01:12:03,914
It were best he speak no harm
of Brutus here!

1072
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:06,718
- This Caesar was a tyrant!
- Nay, that's certain.

1073
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:09,157
We are blessed that Rome is rid of him!

1074
01:12:10,061 --> 01:12:12,222
You gentle Romans.

1075
01:12:14,332 --> 01:12:16,323
Gentle Romans, hear me!

1076
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:29,071
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears.

1077
01:12:35,354 --> 01:12:38,791
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

1078
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:44,190
The evil that men do lives after them,
the good is oft interred with their bones.

1079
01:12:44,264 --> 01:12:46,061
So let it be with Caesar.

1080
01:12:48,235 --> 01:12:51,671
The noble Brutus hath told you
Caesar was ambitious.

1081
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:55,504
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,

1082
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,874
and grievously hath Caesar answered it.

1083
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:04,246
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,
for Brutus is an honorable man,

1084
01:13:04,953 --> 01:13:07,443
so are they all, all honorable men,

1085
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:10,715
come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

1086
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:15,188
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.

1087
01:13:16,298 --> 01:13:18,425
But Brutus says he was ambitious,

1088
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:21,260
and Brutus is an honorable man.

1089
01:13:23,004 --> 01:13:25,336
He hath brought many captives
home to Rome,

1090
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:29,640
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

1091
01:13:31,514 --> 01:13:34,210
When that the poor have cried,
Caesar hath wept.

1092
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:38,545
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.

1093
01:13:39,655 --> 01:13:42,249
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,

1094
01:13:43,093 --> 01:13:45,322
and Brutus is an honorable man.

1095
01:13:47,196 --> 01:13:51,861
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

1096
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:54,465
which he did thrice refuse.

1097
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:57,233
Was this ambition?

1098
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:02,311
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
and, sure, he is an honorable man.

1099
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:09,115
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

1100
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,821
but here I am to speak what I do know.

1101
01:14:13,925 --> 01:14:16,826
You all did love him once,
not without cause.

1102
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:20,527
What cause withholds
you then to mourn for him?

1103
01:14:21,733 --> 01:14:24,702
O judgment!
Thou art fled to brutish beasts,

1104
01:14:24,937 --> 01:14:27,166
and men have lost their reason!

1105
01:14:33,646 --> 01:14:36,480
Bear with me.
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

1106
01:14:36,549 --> 01:14:38,983
and I must pause till it come back to me.

1107
01:14:46,593 --> 01:14:49,494
Methinks there is much reason
in his saying.

1108
01:14:51,865 --> 01:14:55,665
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Caesar has had great wrong.

1109
01:14:56,069 --> 01:14:57,662
Has he, masters?

1110
01:14:57,971 --> 01:15:00,496
I fear there will a worse come in his place.

1111
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:02,232
Marked ye his words?

1112
01:15:02,475 --> 01:15:03,943
He would not take the crown.

1113
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:06,377
Therefore it is certain
he was not ambitious.

1114
01:15:06,447 --> 01:15:09,281
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

1115
01:15:10,518 --> 01:15:13,078
There's not a nobler man
in Rome than Antony.

1116
01:15:13,522 --> 01:15:17,480
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

1117
01:15:18,025 --> 01:15:21,461
Poor soul.
His eyes are red as fire with weeping.

1118
01:15:22,598 --> 01:15:26,762
But yesterday, the word of Caesar
might have stood against the world.

1119
01:15:27,769 --> 01:15:31,900
Now lies he there, and none
so poor to do him reverence.

1120
01:15:33,943 --> 01:15:35,843
O masters!

1121
01:15:37,313 --> 01:15:42,272
If I were disposed to stir your hearts
and minds to mutiny and rage,

1122
01:15:42,452 --> 01:15:45,319
I should do Brutus wrong
and Cassius wrong,

1123
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:49,221
who, you all know, are honorable men.

1124
01:15:51,128 --> 01:15:53,221
I will not do them wrong.

1125
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:55,989
I rather choose to wrong the dead,

1126
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:59,695
to wrong myself and you,
than I will wrong such honorable men.

1127
01:16:00,638 --> 01:16:02,503
But here's a parchment

1128
01:16:02,873 --> 01:16:06,639
with the seal of Caesar.
I found it in his closet. 'Tis his will.

1129
01:16:07,077 --> 01:16:09,546
Let but the commons hear this testament,

1130
01:16:10,815 --> 01:16:13,612
which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,

1131
01:16:14,085 --> 01:16:17,179
and they would go
and kiss dead Caesar's wounds,

1132
01:16:17,856 --> 01:16:20,347
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood,

1133
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:24,891
yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
and, dying, mention it within their wills,

1134
01:16:25,097 --> 01:16:27,998
bequeathing it as a rich legacy
unto their issue.

1135
01:16:28,067 --> 01:16:30,500
We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony!

1136
01:16:30,568 --> 01:16:32,537
We will hear Caesar's will!

1137
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:34,197
- The will!
- The will!

1138
01:16:34,273 --> 01:16:35,262
We'll hear it, Antony!

1139
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,174
Have patience, gentle friends.
I must not read it.

1140
01:16:38,944 --> 01:16:41,879
It is not meet you know
how Caesar loved you.

1141
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:45,182
You are not wood,
you are not stones, but men.

1142
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:48,084
And being men, hearing the will of Caesar,

1143
01:16:48,155 --> 01:16:50,384
it will inflame you, it will make you mad.

1144
01:16:50,924 --> 01:16:53,688
It is good you know not
that you are his heirs.

1145
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:56,518
For if you should,
O what would come of it?

1146
01:16:56,596 --> 01:16:58,564
Read the will. We'll hear it, Antony!

1147
01:16:58,632 --> 01:17:01,226
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will!

1148
01:17:01,335 --> 01:17:02,769
Read us the will!

1149
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:06,529
Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?

1150
01:17:06,641 --> 01:17:09,074
I have overshot myself to tell you of it.

1151
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:13,770
I fear I wrong the honorable men
whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.

1152
01:17:13,848 --> 01:17:15,679
They were traitors. Honorable men!

1153
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,445
- They were villains, murderers!
- The will!

1154
01:17:17,518 --> 01:17:18,952
The will!

1155
01:17:23,492 --> 01:17:25,926
You will compel me then to read the will?

1156
01:17:26,095 --> 01:17:28,359
Then make a ring around
the corpse of Caesar,

1157
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:30,625
and let me show you him
that made the will.

1158
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:33,031
Shall I descend,
and will you give me leave?

1159
01:17:33,102 --> 01:17:37,436
- Come down!
- Come down!

1160
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,860
If you have tears,

1161
01:18:00,397 --> 01:18:02,866
prepare to shed them now.

1162
01:18:07,004 --> 01:18:09,131
You all do know this mantle.

1163
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,934
I remember the first time ever
Caesar put it on.

1164
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:17,371
It was on a summer's evening in his tent
that day he overcame the Nervii.

1165
01:18:18,216 --> 01:18:20,980
Look, in this place ran
Cassius' dagger through.

1166
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:23,747
See what a rent the envious Casca made.

1167
01:18:23,822 --> 01:18:27,417
Through this
the well-beloved Brutus stabbed,

1168
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:32,787
and, as he plucked his cursed steel away,
mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,

1169
01:18:33,265 --> 01:18:37,635
as rushing out of doors, to be resolved
if Brutus so unkindly knocked or no.

1170
01:18:38,137 --> 01:18:40,662
For Brutus, as you know,
was Caesar's angel.

1171
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:44,437
Judge, O you gods,
how dearly Caesar loved him!

1172
01:18:44,911 --> 01:18:47,744
This was the most unkindest cut of all.

1173
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:51,609
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
ingratitude,

1174
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,182
more strong than traitors' arms,
quite vanquished him,

1175
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,353
then burst his mighty heart,

1176
01:18:57,424 --> 01:18:59,722
and, in his mantle muffling up his face,

1177
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:03,827
even at the base of Pompey's statue,
which all the while ran blood,

1178
01:19:04,798 --> 01:19:06,925
great Caesar fell.

1179
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:12,335
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

1180
01:19:13,274 --> 01:19:14,639
Then I,

1181
01:19:14,976 --> 01:19:17,877
and you, and all of us fell down,

1182
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:20,880
whilst bloody treason flourished over us.

1183
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:26,819
Oh.

1184
01:19:27,589 --> 01:19:29,717
Now you weep.

1185
01:19:30,626 --> 01:19:33,789
And I perceive you feel the dint of pity.

1186
01:19:35,363 --> 01:19:37,457
These are gracious drops.

1187
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:44,066
Kind souls, what, weep you when you
but behold our Caesar's vesture wounded?

1188
01:19:45,242 --> 01:19:46,833
Look you here.

1189
01:19:47,076 --> 01:19:50,375
Here is himself, marred,
as you see, with traitors.

1190
01:19:54,751 --> 01:19:56,378
O noble Caesar.

1191
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,485
O most bloody sight.

1192
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:11,858
- Traitors.
- Villains.

1193
01:20:17,508 --> 01:20:21,239
- We will be revenged!
- Let not a traitor live!

1194
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,077
Stay, countrymen!

1195
01:20:28,853 --> 01:20:33,450
Good friends, sweet friends,
let me not stir you up

1196
01:20:33,525 --> 01:20:35,755
to such a sudden flood of mutiny.

1197
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:39,153
They that have done this deed
are honorable.

1198
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:43,260
What private griefs they have, alas,
I know not

1199
01:20:43,336 --> 01:20:44,803
that made them do it.

1200
01:20:44,871 --> 01:20:46,702
They are wise and honorable,

1201
01:20:46,773 --> 01:20:49,435
and will, no doubt,
with reasons answer you.

1202
01:20:51,311 --> 01:20:53,779
I come not, friends,
to steal away your hearts.

1203
01:20:53,846 --> 01:20:56,041
I am no orator, as Brutus is,

1204
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:59,217
but, as you know me all,
a plain blunt man

1205
01:20:59,285 --> 01:21:02,619
that loved my friend,
and that they know full well

1206
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,954
that gave me public leave to speak of him.

1207
01:21:05,025 --> 01:21:08,892
For I have neither wit, nor words,
nor worth, action, nor utterance,

1208
01:21:08,963 --> 01:21:11,557
nor the power of speech
to stir men's blood.

1209
01:21:11,799 --> 01:21:15,496
I only speak right on. I tell you that
which you yourselves do know,

1210
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:19,866
show you sweet Caesar's wounds,
poor, poor dumb mouths,

1211
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:21,772
and bid them speak for me.

1212
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:26,102
But were I Brutus, and Brutus Antony,

1213
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:30,351
there were an Antony
would ruffle up your spirits,

1214
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:33,379
and put a tongue
in every wound of Caesar

1215
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,185
that should move the stones of Rome
to rise and mutiny.

1216
01:21:36,257 --> 01:21:38,488
We'll mutiny!
We'll burn the house of Brutus!

1217
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,654
- Yet hear me, countrymen!
- We'll mutiny!

1218
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:42,424
Yet hear me speak!

1219
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,898
Why, friends, you go
to do you know not what.

1220
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:48,932
Wherein hath Caesar
thus deserved your love?

1221
01:21:49,006 --> 01:21:52,373
Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.

1222
01:21:52,442 --> 01:21:54,273
You have forgot the will I told you of.

1223
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:55,503
The will!

1224
01:21:57,814 --> 01:22:01,306
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.

1225
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:07,051
To every Roman citizen he gives,
to every several man,

1226
01:22:07,524 --> 01:22:09,424
75 drachmas!

1227
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,888
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,

1228
01:22:16,534 --> 01:22:20,493
his private arbors and new-planted
orchards on this side Tiber.

1229
01:22:21,673 --> 01:22:24,734
He hath left them you
and to your heirs forever.

1230
01:22:25,511 --> 01:22:29,446
Common pleasures,
to walk abroad and recreate yourselves.

1231
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:33,914
Here was a Caesar.

1232
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:38,318
When comes such another?

1233
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,823
Never, never!

1234
01:22:42,561 --> 01:22:43,892
Go fetch fire!

1235
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:46,864
Come away, away!

1236
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:01,199
These many then shall die.
Their names are pricked.

1237
01:24:01,277 --> 01:24:03,006
Your brother too must die.

1238
01:24:03,513 --> 01:24:05,708
- Consent you, Lepidus?
- I do consent.

1239
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:07,374
Prick him down, Antony.

1240
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:09,783
Upon condition Publius shall not live,

1241
01:24:10,654 --> 01:24:12,918
who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.

1242
01:24:13,557 --> 01:24:16,549
He shall not live.
Look, with a spot, I damn him.

1243
01:24:18,563 --> 01:24:21,087
But, Lepidus, go you fetch Caesar's will,

1244
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:24,633
and we then shall determine
how to cut off some charge in legacies.

1245
01:24:24,702 --> 01:24:26,067
What, shall I meet you here?

1246
01:24:26,137 --> 01:24:28,162
Or here, or at the Capitol.

1247
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:39,380
This is a slight unmeritable man,
meet to be sent on errands.

1248
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:42,377
Is it fit, the three-fold world divided,

1249
01:24:42,454 --> 01:24:44,751
he should stand
one of the three to share it?

1250
01:24:44,824 --> 01:24:46,291
So you thought him.

1251
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:48,654
And took his voice
who should be pricked to die

1252
01:24:48,728 --> 01:24:51,094
in our black sentence and prescription.

1253
01:24:52,165 --> 01:24:54,895
Octavius, I have seen more days than you.

1254
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:57,294
And though we lay these honors
on this man

1255
01:24:57,369 --> 01:25:00,031
to ease ourselves
of diverse slanderous loads,

1256
01:25:00,372 --> 01:25:03,308
he shall but bear them
as the ass bears gold,

1257
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:08,080
to groan and sweat under the business,
either led or driven, as we point the way.

1258
01:25:08,315 --> 01:25:10,306
And having brought our treasure
where we will,

1259
01:25:10,383 --> 01:25:12,978
then take we down his load
and turn him off,

1260
01:25:13,154 --> 01:25:16,816
like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
and graze in common.

1261
01:25:16,924 --> 01:25:20,621
You may do your will,
but he's a tried and valiant soldier.

1262
01:25:21,028 --> 01:25:25,488
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
I do appoint him store of provender.

1263
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:28,262
And now, Octavius, listen great things.

1264
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:31,301
Brutus and Cassius are levying powers.

1265
01:25:31,373 --> 01:25:32,634
We must straight make head.

1266
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:35,142
Therefore let our alliance be combined,

1267
01:25:35,277 --> 01:25:36,904
and let us presently go sit in council,

1268
01:25:36,979 --> 01:25:39,470
how covert matters
may be best disclosed

1269
01:25:39,548 --> 01:25:41,413
and open perils surest answered.

1270
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:46,318
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
and bayed about with many enemies,

1271
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:50,687
and some that smile have in their hearts,
I fear, millions of mischiefs.

1272
01:26:58,865 --> 01:27:01,766
Stand, ho!

1273
01:27:02,636 --> 01:27:06,093
Give the word, ho!

1274
01:27:06,306 --> 01:27:07,966
Stand, ho!

1275
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,372
Stand, ho.

1276
01:27:21,054 --> 01:27:23,114
What now, Lucilius? Is Cassius near?

1277
01:27:23,191 --> 01:27:27,150
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
to do you salutation from his master.

1278
01:27:30,264 --> 01:27:31,926
He greets me well.

1279
01:27:32,467 --> 01:27:35,198
Your master, Pindarus,
in his own change, or by ill officers,

1280
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:38,603
hath given me some worthy cause
to wish things done, undone,

1281
01:27:38,673 --> 01:27:40,369
but if he be at hand, I shall be satisfied.

1282
01:27:40,442 --> 01:27:43,376
I do not doubt but that
my noble master will appear,

1283
01:27:43,445 --> 01:27:45,538
such as he is, full of regard and honor.

1284
01:27:45,614 --> 01:27:47,275
He is not doubted.

1285
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:52,083
A word, Lucilius.
How he received you, let me be resolved.

1286
01:27:52,422 --> 01:27:55,879
With courtesy and with respect enough,
but not with such familiar instances,

1287
01:27:55,959 --> 01:27:59,291
nor with such free and friendly
conference, as he hath used of old.

1288
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:02,058
Thou has described a hot friend cooling.

1289
01:28:02,198 --> 01:28:05,167
Ever note, Lucilius, when love begins
to sicken and decay,

1290
01:28:05,235 --> 01:28:07,430
it useth an enforced ceremony.

1291
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:09,595
There are no tricks
in plain and simple faith.

1292
01:28:09,672 --> 01:28:11,163
Stand, ho!

1293
01:28:24,822 --> 01:28:26,882
Most noble brother,
you have done me wrong.

1294
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:29,653
Judge me, you gods!
Wrong I mine enemies?

1295
01:28:29,727 --> 01:28:31,160
And, if not so,
how should I wrong a brother?

1296
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:34,130
Brutus, this sober form of yours
hides wrongs, and when you do them...

1297
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:36,827
Cassius, be content.
Speak your griefs softly.

1298
01:28:36,935 --> 01:28:38,231
I do know you well.

1299
01:28:38,302 --> 01:28:40,863
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
which should perceive nothing

1300
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:43,305
but love from us, let us not wrangle.

1301
01:28:46,144 --> 01:28:49,546
That you have wronged me doth appear
in this. You have condemned and noted

1302
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:52,550
Lucius Pella for taking bribes here
of the Sardians.

1303
01:28:53,052 --> 01:28:57,079
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
because I knew the man, were slighted off.

1304
01:28:57,156 --> 01:28:59,181
You wronged yourself
to write in such a case.

1305
01:28:59,258 --> 01:29:01,249
In such a time as this it is not meet
that every nice offense

1306
01:29:01,327 --> 01:29:02,351
should bear its comment.

1307
01:29:02,428 --> 01:29:04,363
Let me tell you, Cassius,
you yourself are much condemned

1308
01:29:04,431 --> 01:29:05,625
to have an itching palm,

1309
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:08,293
to sell and mart your offices
for gold to undeservers.

1310
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:10,461
I an itching palm!

1311
01:29:11,171 --> 01:29:12,660
You know that you are Brutus
that speak this,

1312
01:29:12,738 --> 01:29:15,230
or, by the gods,
this speech were else your last!

1313
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:17,641
The name of Cassius honors
this corruption,

1314
01:29:17,712 --> 01:29:19,542
and chastisement doth, therefore,
hide his head.

1315
01:29:19,614 --> 01:29:20,638
Chastisement!

1316
01:29:20,714 --> 01:29:23,239
Remember March,
the ides of March, remember.

1317
01:29:23,585 --> 01:29:26,145
Did not great Julius bleed
for justice sake?

1318
01:29:26,553 --> 01:29:29,489
What villain touched his body
that did stab, and not for justice?

1319
01:29:29,557 --> 01:29:32,617
What, shall one of us that struck
the foremost man of all this world

1320
01:29:32,694 --> 01:29:36,630
but for supporting robbers, shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes,

1321
01:29:36,698 --> 01:29:40,259
and sell the mighty space
of our large honors for so much trash

1322
01:29:40,503 --> 01:29:42,130
as may be grasped thus?

1323
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:45,339
I'd rather be a dog and bay the moon
than such a Roman.

1324
01:29:45,407 --> 01:29:47,398
Brutus, bay not me. I'll not endure it.

1325
01:29:47,476 --> 01:29:49,273
You forget yourself to hedge me in.

1326
01:29:49,345 --> 01:29:52,542
I am a soldier, I, older in action,
abler than yourself to make conditions.

1327
01:29:52,615 --> 01:29:53,946
Go to. You are not Cassius.

1328
01:29:54,016 --> 01:29:55,574
- I am.
- I say you are not.

1329
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:57,209
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself.

1330
01:29:57,286 --> 01:29:59,618
Have mind upon your health.
Tempt me no further.

1331
01:29:59,688 --> 01:30:01,316
Away, slight man.

1332
01:30:03,058 --> 01:30:04,117
Is it possible?

1333
01:30:04,194 --> 01:30:06,593
Must I give way and room
to your rash choler?

1334
01:30:06,662 --> 01:30:09,153
Shall I be frighted
when a madman stares?

1335
01:30:09,533 --> 01:30:13,025
O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?

1336
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:16,205
All this! Ay, more.
Fret till your proud heart breaks.

1337
01:30:16,274 --> 01:30:19,401
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
and make your bondmen tremble.

1338
01:30:19,476 --> 01:30:20,943
Must I budge?

1339
01:30:21,044 --> 01:30:22,103
Must I observe you?

1340
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,705
Must I stand and crouch
under your testy humor?

1341
01:30:24,782 --> 01:30:27,273
By the gods, you shall digest
the venom of your spleen,

1342
01:30:27,351 --> 01:30:29,512
though it do split you,
for, from this day forth,

1343
01:30:29,587 --> 01:30:33,023
I'll use you for my mirth, yea,
for my laughter, when you are waspish.

1344
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:34,649
Is it come to this?

1345
01:30:34,725 --> 01:30:35,818
You say you are a better soldier.

1346
01:30:35,894 --> 01:30:38,988
Let it appear so. Make your vaunting true,
and it shall please me well.

1347
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:42,227
For mine own part, I shall be glad
to learn of noble men.

1348
01:30:42,633 --> 01:30:45,125
You wrong me every way.
You wrong me, Brutus.

1349
01:30:45,204 --> 01:30:47,502
I said an elder soldier, not a better.

1350
01:30:47,873 --> 01:30:50,707
- Did I say better?
- If you did, I care not.

1351
01:30:51,144 --> 01:30:53,611
When Caesar lived,
he durst not thus have moved me.

1352
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,513
Peace, peace!
You durst not so have tempted him.

1353
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,141
- I durst not!
- No!

1354
01:30:58,218 --> 01:30:59,548
What, durst not tempt him?

1355
01:30:59,618 --> 01:31:00,881
For your life you durst not.

1356
01:31:00,954 --> 01:31:05,050
Do not presume too much upon my love.
I may do that I shall be sorry for.

1357
01:31:05,124 --> 01:31:07,615
You have done that
you should be sorry for.

1358
01:31:07,727 --> 01:31:11,323
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
for I am armed so strong in honesty,

1359
01:31:11,398 --> 01:31:15,060
that they pass by me as the idle wind,
which I respect not.

1360
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:19,495
I did send to you for certain sums of gold,
which you denied me,

1361
01:31:19,573 --> 01:31:22,007
for I can raise no money by vile means.

1362
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:26,202
I did send to you for gold
to pay my legions, which you denied me.

1363
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:27,438
Was that done like Cassius?

1364
01:31:27,514 --> 01:31:28,879
- I denied you not!
- You did.

1365
01:31:28,949 --> 01:31:32,113
I did not. He was but a fool
that brought my answer back.

1366
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:33,982
Brutus has rived my heart.

1367
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,456
A friend should bear
his friend's infirmities,

1368
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,151
but Brutus makes mine
greater than they are.

1369
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:40,160
I do not, till you practice them on me.

1370
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:42,355
- You love me not.
- I do not like your faults.

1371
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,365
A friendly eye could never see such faults.

1372
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:45,956
A flatterer's would not,

1373
01:31:46,034 --> 01:31:48,298
though they do appear as huge
as high Olympus.

1374
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,366
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,

1375
01:31:55,778 --> 01:31:58,372
revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,

1376
01:31:58,948 --> 01:32:01,109
for Cassius is aweary of the world.

1377
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:04,111
Hated by one he loves,
braved by his brother,

1378
01:32:04,487 --> 01:32:08,151
checked like a bondman,
all his faults observed,

1379
01:32:08,225 --> 01:32:12,855
set in a notebook, learned and conned
by rote to cast into my teeth.

1380
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:16,728
O, I could weep the spirit from mine eyes!

1381
01:32:18,669 --> 01:32:21,001
Here is my dagger,
and here my naked breast.

1382
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:23,562
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth.

1383
01:32:23,707 --> 01:32:26,267
I, that denied thee gold,
will give my heart.

1384
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:28,875
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar,

1385
01:32:29,213 --> 01:32:31,738
for, I know, when thou didst
hate him worst,

1386
01:32:32,116 --> 01:32:36,917
thou lovedst him better
than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

1387
01:32:37,789 --> 01:32:39,417
Sheathe your dagger.

1388
01:32:39,824 --> 01:32:41,952
Be angry when you will,
it shall have scope.

1389
01:32:42,027 --> 01:32:44,494
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.

1390
01:32:44,663 --> 01:32:48,030
Hath Cassius lived to be but mirth
and laughter to his Brutus,

1391
01:32:48,434 --> 01:32:50,994
when grief and blood
ill-tempered vexeth him?

1392
01:32:51,136 --> 01:32:53,627
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered, too.

1393
01:32:54,373 --> 01:32:56,273
Do you confess so much?

1394
01:32:56,608 --> 01:32:59,544
- Give me your hand.
- And my heart, too.

1395
01:33:00,045 --> 01:33:03,776
O Brutus, have you not love enough
to bear with me,

1396
01:33:03,983 --> 01:33:07,441
when that rash humor that my mother
gave me makes me forgetful?

1397
01:33:07,653 --> 01:33:08,882
Yes, Cassius.

1398
01:33:09,456 --> 01:33:12,892
And from henceforth, when you are
over-earnest with your Brutus,

1399
01:33:12,959 --> 01:33:16,520
he'll think your mother chides,
and leave you so.

1400
01:33:19,266 --> 01:33:23,532
Lucilius, bid the commanders prepare
to lodge their companies tonight.

1401
01:33:23,804 --> 01:33:27,763
And come yourself, and bring Messala
with you immediately to us.

1402
01:33:30,111 --> 01:33:34,445
Lucius, a bowl of wine.

1403
01:33:40,922 --> 01:33:43,152
I did not think
you could have been so angry.

1404
01:33:45,293 --> 01:33:49,662
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

1405
01:33:50,132 --> 01:33:54,626
Of your philosophy you make no use,
if you give place to accidental evils.

1406
01:33:55,804 --> 01:33:58,205
No man bears sorrow better.

1407
01:33:59,909 --> 01:34:01,433
Portia is dead.

1408
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:05,913
Portia?

1409
01:34:08,217 --> 01:34:09,616
She is dead.

1410
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,984
How escaped I killing
when I crossed you so?

1411
01:34:14,458 --> 01:34:16,892
O, insupportable and touching loss!

1412
01:34:18,661 --> 01:34:20,391
Upon what sickness?

1413
01:34:22,332 --> 01:34:25,529
Impatient of my absence,
and grief that young Octavius

1414
01:34:25,602 --> 01:34:28,070
with Mark Antony
have made themselves so strong,

1415
01:34:28,839 --> 01:34:31,205
for with her death that tidings came.

1416
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:33,977
With this she fell distract,

1417
01:34:34,678 --> 01:34:38,410
and, her attendants absent,
swallowed fire.

1418
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,648
And died so?

1419
01:34:41,653 --> 01:34:42,881
Even so.

1420
01:34:43,555 --> 01:34:45,352
O ye immortal gods.

1421
01:34:47,392 --> 01:34:49,189
Speak no more of her.

1422
01:35:09,615 --> 01:35:12,641
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

1423
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:15,917
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.

1424
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,263
Come in, Lucilius.

1425
01:35:25,332 --> 01:35:26,595
Welcome, good Messala.

1426
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:30,898
Now, sit we close about this taper here,
and call in question our necessities.

1427
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,705
- Portia, art thou gone?
- No more, I pray you.

1428
01:35:37,211 --> 01:35:38,872
Messala, I have here received letters

1429
01:35:38,946 --> 01:35:42,507
that young Octavius and Mark Antony
come down upon us with a mighty power,

1430
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:44,949
bending their expedition toward Philippi.

1431
01:35:45,019 --> 01:35:47,284
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.

1432
01:35:47,356 --> 01:35:48,686
With what addition?

1433
01:35:48,756 --> 01:35:50,748
That by prescription and bills of outlawry,

1434
01:35:50,826 --> 01:35:54,091
Octavius, Antony and Lepidus
have put to death 100 senators.

1435
01:35:54,162 --> 01:35:55,254
Therein our letters do not well agree.

1436
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:58,095
Mine speak of 70 senators
that died by their prescriptions,

1437
01:35:58,166 --> 01:35:59,497
Cicero being one.

1438
01:35:59,668 --> 01:36:02,228
- Cicero?
- Cicero is dead,

1439
01:36:02,371 --> 01:36:04,602
and by that order of prescription.

1440
01:36:07,543 --> 01:36:10,274
Had you your letters
from your wife, my lord?

1441
01:36:11,681 --> 01:36:13,148
No, Messala.

1442
01:36:13,316 --> 01:36:15,682
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

1443
01:36:15,752 --> 01:36:17,379
Nothing, Messala.

1444
01:36:17,487 --> 01:36:19,080
Well, to our work alive.

1445
01:36:19,156 --> 01:36:21,453
What do you think of marching
to Philippi presently?

1446
01:36:21,524 --> 01:36:24,050
- I do not think it good.
- Your reason?

1447
01:36:24,727 --> 01:36:27,856
This it is. 'Tis better
that the enemy seek us.

1448
01:36:28,265 --> 01:36:31,632
So shall he waste his means,
weary his soldiers, doing himself offense,

1449
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:35,069
whilst we, lying still, are full of rest,
defense, and nimbleness.

1450
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,664
Good reasons must, of force,
give place to better.

1451
01:36:37,741 --> 01:36:39,676
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground

1452
01:36:39,744 --> 01:36:41,211
do stand but in a forced affection.

1453
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:42,803
Hear me, good brother.

1454
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,541
Under your pardon.

1455
01:36:46,985 --> 01:36:50,580
You must note, beside, that we have
tried the utmost of our friends.

1456
01:36:50,655 --> 01:36:53,489
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe.

1457
01:36:53,692 --> 01:36:58,096
The enemy increaseth every day.
We, at the height, are ready to decline.

1458
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:00,799
There is a tide in the affairs of men,

1459
01:37:00,865 --> 01:37:03,595
which, taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune.

1460
01:37:03,668 --> 01:37:08,163
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries.

1461
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:11,233
On such a full sea are we now afloat,

1462
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:14,905
and we must take the current
when it serves, or lose our ventures.

1463
01:37:15,481 --> 01:37:17,575
Then, with your will, go on.

1464
01:37:18,685 --> 01:37:21,711
We'll along ourselves,
and meet them at Philippi.

1465
01:37:22,022 --> 01:37:23,990
There is no more to say?

1466
01:37:24,424 --> 01:37:25,653
No more.

1467
01:37:26,927 --> 01:37:28,087
Good night.

1468
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:30,630
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.

1469
01:37:32,366 --> 01:37:33,958
Lucius, my gown!

1470
01:37:35,403 --> 01:37:37,927
- Good night, Lucilius.
- Good night, my lord.

1471
01:37:39,073 --> 01:37:40,665
Farewell, good Messala.

1472
01:37:40,742 --> 01:37:42,709
Good night, Lord Brutus.

1473
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:47,745
Noble, noble Cassius,
good night, and good repose.

1474
01:37:47,815 --> 01:37:48,908
O my dear brother.

1475
01:37:48,983 --> 01:37:51,349
This was an ill beginning to the night.

1476
01:37:51,819 --> 01:37:54,288
Never come such division 'twixt our souls.

1477
01:37:54,957 --> 01:37:56,253
Let it not, Brutus.

1478
01:37:56,325 --> 01:37:58,054
Everything is well.

1479
01:37:58,661 --> 01:38:00,424
Good night, my lord.

1480
01:38:00,663 --> 01:38:02,654
Good night, good brother.

1481
01:38:18,915 --> 01:38:22,681
- Where is thy instrument?
- Here in the tent, sir.

1482
01:38:22,952 --> 01:38:25,114
What, thou speak'st drowsily?

1483
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:28,090
Poor knave, I blame thee not.
Thou art over-watched.

1484
01:38:28,826 --> 01:38:30,520
Call Claudius and some other of my men.

1485
01:38:30,593 --> 01:38:33,119
I'll have them sleep on cushions
by my tent.

1486
01:38:34,632 --> 01:38:36,429
Varro and Claudius.

1487
01:38:38,969 --> 01:38:42,268
Look, Lucius,
here's the book I sought for so.

1488
01:38:42,441 --> 01:38:44,568
I put it in the pocket of my gown.

1489
01:38:44,675 --> 01:38:46,541
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

1490
01:38:46,611 --> 01:38:49,306
Bear with me, good boy,
I am much forgetful.

1491
01:38:49,815 --> 01:38:51,475
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,

1492
01:38:51,549 --> 01:38:53,279
and touch thy instrument
a strain or two?

1493
01:38:53,351 --> 01:38:54,909
Ay, my lord, an't please you.

1494
01:38:54,986 --> 01:38:58,217
It does, my boy. I trouble thee too much,
but thou art willing.

1495
01:38:58,290 --> 01:38:59,757
'Tis my duty, sir.

1496
01:38:59,825 --> 01:39:01,884
I should not urge thy duty past thy might.

1497
01:39:01,961 --> 01:39:04,053
I know young bloods
look for a time of rest.

1498
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:06,030
I have slept, my lord, already.

1499
01:39:06,098 --> 01:39:08,329
It was well done,
and thou shalt sleep again.

1500
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,130
I will not hold thee long.

1501
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:14,361
If I do live, I will be good to thee.

1502
01:39:26,587 --> 01:39:29,852
<i>Now, O now</i>

1503
01:39:29,923 --> 01:39:34,417
<i>I needs must part</i>

1504
01:39:35,129 --> 01:39:39,998
<i>Joy once fled cannot return</i>

1505
01:39:42,203 --> 01:39:46,435
<i>If that parting</i>

1506
01:39:46,508 --> 01:39:50,808
<i>be offense</i>

1507
01:39:51,579 --> 01:39:54,743
<i>It is she</i>

1508
01:39:55,084 --> 01:39:57,608
This is a sleepy tune.

1509
01:39:57,887 --> 01:40:00,753
<i>Which thus offends</i>

1510
01:40:10,132 --> 01:40:12,123
O murderous slumber,

1511
01:40:12,269 --> 01:40:16,171
lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
that plays thee music?

1512
01:40:17,808 --> 01:40:22,802
Gentle knave, good night. I will not
do thee so much wrong to wake thee.

1513
01:40:38,129 --> 01:40:41,565
And, good boy, good night.

1514
01:40:44,168 --> 01:40:49,128
Let me see, let me see. Is not the leaf
turned down where I left reading?

1515
01:40:50,975 --> 01:40:52,738
Here it is, I think.

1516
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:29,376
How ill this taper burns.

1517
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:40,817
Who comes here?

1518
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:48,528
I think it is the weakness of my eyes
that shapes this monstrous apparition.

1519
01:41:53,975 --> 01:41:55,635
Art thou anything?

1520
01:41:56,811 --> 01:42:00,941
Art thou some god, some angel,
or some devil,

1521
01:42:01,383 --> 01:42:05,150
that mak'st my blood cold
and my hair to stare?

1522
01:42:06,555 --> 01:42:08,580
Speak to me what thou art!

1523
01:42:09,057 --> 01:42:11,219
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.

1524
01:42:12,628 --> 01:42:14,528
Why com'st thou?

1525
01:42:14,931 --> 01:42:19,925
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

1526
01:42:20,803 --> 01:42:24,672
Well, then I shall see thee again.

1527
01:42:25,408 --> 01:42:28,969
Ay, at Philippi.

1528
01:42:29,713 --> 01:42:31,078
Why,

1529
01:42:33,283 --> 01:42:35,342
I will see thee at Philippi, then!

1530
01:42:39,256 --> 01:42:41,520
Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest.

1531
01:42:44,362 --> 01:42:47,296
III spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.

1532
01:42:51,436 --> 01:42:54,803
Boy, Lucius! Lucius, awake!

1533
01:42:55,274 --> 01:42:56,298
My lord?

1534
01:42:56,374 --> 01:42:58,275
Didst thou dream, Lucius,
that thou so criedst out?

1535
01:42:58,344 --> 01:43:00,005
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

1536
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:01,670
Yes, that thou didst.
Didst thou see anything?

1537
01:43:01,746 --> 01:43:03,374
Nothing, my lord.

1538
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:06,083
Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake!

1539
01:43:06,885 --> 01:43:07,943
- My lord.
- My lord.

1540
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:10,250
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

1541
01:43:10,322 --> 01:43:11,380
Did we, my lord?

1542
01:43:11,457 --> 01:43:12,788
Ay. Saw you anything?

1543
01:43:12,858 --> 01:43:15,418
- No, my lord, I saw nothing.
- Nor I, my lord.

1544
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:19,729
Go and commend me
to my brother Cassius.

1545
01:43:19,833 --> 01:43:23,200
Bid him set on his powers
betimes before, and we will follow.

1546
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:25,395
It shall be done, my lord.

1547
01:43:58,406 --> 01:44:01,740
Now, most noble Brutus,
the gods today stand friendly,

1548
01:44:01,877 --> 01:44:04,971
that we may, lovers in peace,
lead on our days to age.

1549
01:44:06,381 --> 01:44:09,248
But, since the affairs of men
rest still uncertain,

1550
01:44:09,619 --> 01:44:11,609
let's reason with the worst
that may befall.

1551
01:44:11,686 --> 01:44:14,087
If we do lose this battle,
then is this the very last time

1552
01:44:14,189 --> 01:44:15,417
we shall speak together.

1553
01:44:16,024 --> 01:44:18,255
What are you, then, determined to do?

1554
01:44:18,528 --> 01:44:21,964
Think not, thou noble Roman,
that ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.

1555
01:44:22,031 --> 01:44:24,056
He bears too great a mind.

1556
01:44:24,233 --> 01:44:27,566
But this same day must end that work
the ides of March begun.

1557
01:44:27,971 --> 01:44:30,701
And whether we shall meet again
I know not.

1558
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,537
Therefore, our everlasting farewell take.

1559
01:44:35,245 --> 01:44:37,611
Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius.

1560
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:41,349
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile.

1561
01:44:41,886 --> 01:44:44,683
If not, why then,
this parting was well made.

1562
01:44:45,456 --> 01:44:48,051
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.

1563
01:44:48,358 --> 01:44:50,827
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed.

1564
01:44:51,528 --> 01:44:54,589
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

1565
01:44:56,101 --> 01:44:57,830
Why, then, lead on.

1566
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:02,933
O, that a man might know the end
of this day's business ere it come.

1567
01:45:03,209 --> 01:45:07,703
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
and then the end is known.

1568
01:45:17,323 --> 01:45:19,315
- Messala.
- What says my general?

1569
01:45:19,859 --> 01:45:23,921
Messala, this is my birthday.
As this very day was Cassius born.

1570
01:45:25,397 --> 01:45:27,263
Give me thy hand, Messala.

1571
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:31,129
Be thou my witness that against my will,
as Pompey was,

1572
01:45:31,438 --> 01:45:34,965
I am compelled to set upon one battle
all our liberties.

1573
01:49:33,827 --> 01:49:36,522
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off!

1574
01:49:36,596 --> 01:49:38,564
This hill is far enough.

1575
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:47,837
Look, look, Titinius.

1576
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:50,976
Are those my tents
where I perceive our light?

1577
01:49:51,912 --> 01:49:53,573
They are, my lord.

1578
01:49:54,214 --> 01:49:56,307
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
mount thou my horse

1579
01:49:56,383 --> 01:49:57,748
and hide thy spurs in him,

1580
01:49:57,818 --> 01:50:00,515
till he have brought thee up
to yonder troops and here again,

1581
01:50:00,588 --> 01:50:03,216
that I may rest assured
whether those troops be friend or enemy.

1582
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:06,090
I will be here again, even with a thought.

1583
01:50:12,167 --> 01:50:14,465
Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill.

1584
01:50:14,603 --> 01:50:16,161
My sight was ever thick.

1585
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:20,071
Regard Titinius, and tell me
what thou notest about the field.

1586
01:50:31,787 --> 01:50:33,618
This day I breathed first.

1587
01:50:34,458 --> 01:50:36,084
Time is come round,

1588
01:50:36,226 --> 01:50:39,422
and where I did begin, there shall I end.

1589
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:41,688
My life is run its compass.

1590
01:50:41,766 --> 01:50:44,132
- My lord!
- Sirrah, what news?

1591
01:50:45,068 --> 01:50:46,365
O, my lord!

1592
01:50:46,471 --> 01:50:50,498
Titinius is enclosed at round about with
horsemen that make to him on the spur.

1593
01:50:50,574 --> 01:50:52,166
Yet he spurs on.

1594
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:54,402
Now they are almost on him.

1595
01:50:54,478 --> 01:50:56,606
Now, Titinius! Now! Now!

1596
01:51:01,385 --> 01:51:02,751
He's taken.

1597
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:09,484
Come down. Behold no more.

1598
01:51:15,601 --> 01:51:19,867
O, coward that I am, to live so long

1599
01:51:19,938 --> 01:51:24,103
to see my best friend taken
before my face.

1600
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:31,540
Come hither, sirrah.

1601
01:51:34,687 --> 01:51:36,882
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,

1602
01:51:37,157 --> 01:51:39,647
and then I swore thee, saving of thy life,

1603
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:42,956
that whatsoever I did bid thee do,
thou shouldst attempt it.

1604
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:44,759
Come now, keep thine oath.

1605
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,666
Now be a freeman,

1606
01:51:49,435 --> 01:51:52,667
and with this good sword,
that ran through Caesar's bowels,

1607
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,673
search this bosom.

1608
01:51:55,009 --> 01:51:57,477
Stand not to answer. Take thou the hilts.

1609
01:51:58,113 --> 01:51:59,705
Guide thou the sword.

1610
01:52:08,523 --> 01:52:10,548
Come now, keep thine oath!

1611
01:53:27,172 --> 01:53:28,333
Where is he?

1612
01:53:28,407 --> 01:53:31,467
Safe, Octavius. Brutus is safe enough.

1613
01:53:31,911 --> 01:53:36,313
I dare assure thee that no enemy
shall ever take alive the noble Brutus.

1614
01:53:53,534 --> 01:53:57,368
Yet, countrymen,
O yet hold up your heads!

1615
01:54:01,042 --> 01:54:05,001
Come, poor remains of friends,
rest on this rock.

1616
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,780
O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet.

1617
01:54:41,818 --> 01:54:46,255
Thy spirit walks abroad
and turns our swords

1618
01:54:47,925 --> 01:54:51,383
in our own proper entrails.

1619
01:55:02,907 --> 01:55:04,568
Hark thee, Clitus.

1620
01:55:10,014 --> 01:55:11,709
What, I, my lord?

1621
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:14,075
No, not for all the world.

1622
01:55:14,419 --> 01:55:17,855
- Peace, then. No words.
- I'd rather kill myself.

1623
01:55:20,259 --> 01:55:24,059
Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word.

1624
01:55:30,102 --> 01:55:31,660
What says my lord?

1625
01:55:31,771 --> 01:55:35,969
Why this, Volumnius.
The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me

1626
01:55:36,041 --> 01:55:37,805
two several times by night,

1627
01:55:37,878 --> 01:55:41,177
at Sardis once, and this last night
here in Philippi fields.

1628
01:55:41,248 --> 01:55:42,839
I know my hour is come.

1629
01:55:42,915 --> 01:55:43,939
Not so, my lord.

1630
01:55:44,017 --> 01:55:47,145
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.

1631
01:55:48,455 --> 01:55:50,980
Thou seest the world, Volumnius,
how it goes.

1632
01:55:51,058 --> 01:55:53,389
Our enemies have beat us to the pit.

1633
01:55:53,961 --> 01:55:58,727
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
than tarry till they push us.

1634
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:03,797
Good Volumnius, thou know'st
that we two went to school together.

1635
01:56:04,372 --> 01:56:08,502
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
hold thou my sword-hilts,

1636
01:56:08,609 --> 01:56:10,338
whilst I run on it.

1637
01:56:11,712 --> 01:56:14,545
That's not an office for a friend, my lord.

1638
01:56:23,425 --> 01:56:26,360
Fly, fly, my lord. There is no tarrying here!

1639
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:33,524
Farewell to you, and you,
and you, Volumnius.

1640
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:38,131
Countrymen, my heart doth joy
that yet, in all my life,

1641
01:56:38,207 --> 01:56:40,676
I found no man but he was true to me.

1642
01:56:41,845 --> 01:56:45,576
I shall have glory by this losing day,
more than Octavius and Mark Antony

1643
01:56:45,648 --> 01:56:48,344
by this vile conquest shall attain unto.

1644
01:56:48,986 --> 01:56:50,715
So, fare you well at once,

1645
01:56:51,322 --> 01:56:54,519
for Brutus' tongue hath almost ended
his life's history.

1646
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:59,552
Night hangs upon mine eyes.
My bones would rest,

1647
01:57:00,564 --> 01:57:03,397
that have but labored to attain this hour.

1648
01:57:26,157 --> 01:57:30,219
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy Lord.

1649
01:57:33,766 --> 01:57:35,563
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.

1650
01:57:35,635 --> 01:57:38,103
Thy life hath had
some smatch of honor in it.

1651
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:43,638
Hold then my sword,
and turn away thy face,

1652
01:57:43,709 --> 01:57:45,540
while I do run upon it.

1653
01:57:45,945 --> 01:57:47,606
Wilt thou, Strato?

1654
01:57:52,419 --> 01:57:54,386
Give me your hand first.

1655
01:57:57,591 --> 01:57:59,491
Fare you well, my lord.

1656
01:58:00,427 --> 01:58:02,293
Farewell, good Strato.

1657
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:24,408
Caesar, now be still.

1658
01:58:24,954 --> 01:58:28,117
I killed not thee with half so good a will.

1659
01:59:21,179 --> 01:59:23,306
According to his virtue,
let us use him

1660
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:26,010
with all respect and rites of burial.

1661
01:59:26,752 --> 01:59:30,279
Within my tent his bones tonight
shall lie, most like a soldier,

1662
01:59:30,456 --> 01:59:32,582
ordered honorably.

1663
01:59:34,459 --> 01:59:37,429
This was the noblest Roman of them all.

1664
01:59:41,434 --> 01:59:45,666
All the conspirators, save only he,
did that they did in envy of great Caesar.

1665
01:59:46,939 --> 01:59:49,534
He only, in a general honest thought

1666
01:59:49,610 --> 01:59:52,044
and common good to all,
made one of them.

1667
01:59:53,047 --> 01:59:54,741
His life was gentle,

1668
01:59:55,516 --> 01:59:57,040
and the elements so mixed in him

1669
01:59:57,117 --> 02:00:00,018
that Nature might stand up
and say to all the world,

1670
02:00:01,655 --> 02:00:03,623
"This was a man."
